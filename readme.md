# Random text classification

The goal of this project is to develop a simple and fast LM to dect fake vs real strings (where fake ones are generated at random) that will be used for real-time evaluation.

## Ngram Model
The simplest possible model, not particularly effective

## 1d CNN
Fast and effective
