albert of prussia was the last grand master of the teutonic knights , who after converting to lutheranism , became the first monarch of the duchy of prussia , the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights . albert was the first european ruler to establish protestantism as the official state religion of his lands . he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage , ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades . a member of the brandenburg-ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern , albert s election as grand master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the teutonic knights . he was a skilled political administrator and leader , and did indeed reverse the decline of the teutonic order . however , albert , who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther , rebelled against the catholic church , and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm , the           his uncle , the king of poland . the arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krakw in 1525 . albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs . albert s rule in prussia was fairly prosperous . although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court . he was active in imperial politics , joining the league of torgau in 1526 , and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 . albert established schools in every town and founded knigsberg university in 1544 . he promoted culture and arts , patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger . albert s final years were clouded by peasant resentment of heavy taxes , a step he felt compelled to take due to there no longer being any church land available to confiscate in           , and paul skali also caused various religious and political disputes . albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power , and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 . his son albert frederick succeeded him as duke of prussia . albert s dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia , paving the way for the rise of the house of hohenzollern . he is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany .  early life  albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i , margrave of brandenburg-ansbach . his mother was sophia , daughter of casimir iv jagiellon , grand duke of lithuania and king of poland , and his wife elisabeth of austria . he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse , elector of cologne , who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral . despite being quite religious , he was also interested in mathematics and           teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories . his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advance . turning to a more active life , albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in 1508 , and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary .  grand master  duke frederick of saxony , grand master of the teutonic order , died in december 1510 . albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle , sigismund i the old , grand duke of lithuania and king of poland , would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia , which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn . the new grand master , aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy , refused to submit to the crown of poland . as war over the order s existence appeared inevitable , albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on           by the ravages of members of the order in poland , culminated in a war which began in december 1519 and devastated prussia . albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521 . the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes , but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war . for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in 1522 , where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander , by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism . the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg , where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order , to marry , and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself . this proposal , which was understandably appealing to albert , had already been discussed by some of his relatives ; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously , and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines . luther           but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians , while albert s brother , margrave george of brandenburg-ansbach , laid the scheme before their uncle , sigismund i the old of poland .  duke in prussia  after some delay sigismund assented to the offer , with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom ; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krakw , albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 february 1525 . the estates of the land then met at knigsberg and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke , who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther . this transition did not , however , take place without protest . summoned before the imperial court of justice , albert refused to appear and was proscribed , while the order elected a new grand master , walter von cronberg , who received prussia as a fief at the           experiencing the tumult of the reformation , the german peasants  war , and the wars against the ottoman turks , they did not enforce the ban on the duke , and agitation against him soon died away . in imperial politics albert was fairly active . joining the league of torgau in 1526 , he acted in unison with the protestants , and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 . for various reasons , however , poverty and personal inclination among others , he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period . the early years of albert s rule in prussia were fairly prosperous . although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court . he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life . in 1544 ,           , where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in 1549 . albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical prutenic tables compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger . this step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of albert s reign . osiander s divergence from luther s doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon , who had adherents in knigsberg , and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town . the duke strenuously supported osiander , and the area of the quarrel soon broadened . there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles , the burden of taxation was heavy , and albert s rule became unpopular . after osiander s death in 1552 , albert favoured a preacher named johann funck , who , with an adventurer named paul skali , exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense . the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the           should that happen , to appoint a regent , as his only son , albert frederick was still a mere youth . the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander , and the climax came in 1566 when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland , albert s cousin , who sent a commission to knigsberg . skali saved his life by flight , but funck was executed . the question of the regency was settled , and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers . virtually deprived of power , the duke lived for two more years , and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 . cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within knigsberg cathedral . albert was a voluminous letter writer , and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time .  legacy  although albert has received relatively little recognition in german history , his dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia , which would eventually become arguably the most powerful           . albert is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany . he was a skilled political administrator and leader , and effectively reversed the decline of the teutonic order , until he betrayed it by transforming the order s lands into his own duchy , secularizing it in the process . albert was the first german noble to support luther s ideas and in 1544 founded the university of knigsberg , the albertina , as a rival to the roman catholic cracow academy . it was the second lutheran university in the german states , after the university of marburg . a relief of albert over the renaissance-era portal of knigsberg castle s southern wing was created by andreas hess in 1551 according to plans by christoph rmer . another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertina s original campus . this depiction , which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder , was the popular albertus , the symbol of the university . the original was moved to           while the sculptor paul kimritz created a duplicate for the wall . another version of the albertus by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the knigsberg state and royal library . in 1880 friedrich reusch created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgebude , the administrative building for regierungsbezirk knigsberg . on 19 may 1891 reusch premiered a famous statue of albert at knigsberg castle with the inscription : albert of brandenburg , last grand master , first duke in prussia . albert wolff also designed an equestrian statue of albert located at the new campus of the albertina . king s gate contains a statue of albert . albert was oft-honored in the quarter maraunenhof in northern knigsberg . its main street was named herzog-albrecht-allee in 1906 . its town square , knig-ottokar-platz , was renamed herzog-albrecht-platz in 1934 to match its church , the **31;17536;toolong  spouse and issue  albert married first , to princess dorothea , daughter of king frederick i of denmark , in 1526 .

at the summer solstice , the shadow was only 1 / 400 th of the staff , and so could scarcely be discerned , and the northern limb of the sun s disc would be nearly vertical . however , eratosthenes used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at alexandria to perform the first known calculation of the circumference of the earth . the nile is nearly 2.7 m wide above aswan . from this frontier town to the northern extremity of egypt , the river flows for more than without bar or cataract . the voyage from aswan to alexandria            climate  aswan has a hot desert climate like the rest of egypt . aswan and luxor have the hottest summer days of any other city in egypt . aswan is one of the hottest , sunniest and driest cities in the world . averages high temperatures are above 40 c during summer while averages low temperatures remain above 25 c . summers are long , prolonged and extremely hot . averages high temperatures remain above 23 c during the coldest month of the year while averages low temperatures remain above 8 c . winters are short , brief and extremely warm . wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry . the climate of aswan is extremely dry year-round , with less than 1 mm of average annual precipitation . the desert city is one of the driest ones in the world , and rainfall does nt occur every           there was seven years earlier . aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet , with an average relative humidity of only 26% , with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer . the climate of aswan is extremely clear , bright and sunny year-round , in all seasons , with a low seasonal variation , with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine , very close of the maximum theoretical sunshine duration . aswan is one of the sunniest places on earth . the highest record temperature was on may 22 , 1973 and the lowest record temperature was on january 6 , 1989. cite web  education  in 1999 , south valley university was inaugurated and it has three branches ;

the government of barbados , is made up structurally of the monarch , queen elizabeth ii as head of state . she is represented by her representative the governor-general , sir elliott belgrave , g.c.m.g. , k.a. , the country has a bicameral legislature and a mature social democratic party system , based on universal adult suffrage and total purity in elections . the senate has 21 members , all appointed by the governor-general on behalf of the monarch , 12 on the advice of the prime minister , two on the advice of the leader of the opposition , and seven in the governor-generals sole discretion . the house of assembly has 30 members , all elected . both houses debate all legislation . however , the house of assembly may ultimately override senate s rejection of money bills and other bills except bills amending the constitution . officers of each house are elected from the members of the respective houses . in           , barbados has evolved into a leading independent parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy , meaning that all real power rests with the parliament , but the country maintains aspects of a historic monarchy/kingdom government also , which allows stability . executive authority is vested in the monarch who grants all functioning of the government to both the prime minister and cabinet who are collectively responsible to parliament . barbadian law is rooted historically on english common law , and the constitution of barbados implemented in 1966 , is supreme law of the land . fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual are set out in the constitution and are protected by a strict legal code . the cabinet is headed by the prime minister who must be an elected mp and other ministers are appointed from either chamber by the governor-general as advised by the prime minister . the governor-general appoints as leader of the opposition the member of house of assembly who commands the support of the largest number of members of that house in opposition to the ruling party s government . the maximum duration of a parliament is           simultaneous dissolution of both houses of parliament by the governor-general acting on the advice of the prime minister . there is an established non-political public service . also , there are separate constitutional commissions for : the judicial and legal service , the public service , and the police service .  history  the government has been chosen by elections since 1961 elections , when barbados achieved full self-governance . before then , the government was a crown colony consisting of either colonial administration solely , or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly , such as the legislative council . since independence , the barbados labour party governed from 1976 to 1986 , and from september 1994 2008 . the democratic labour party held office 1966 to 1976 , from 1986 to 1994 , and has formed the government january 2008 to present .  executive branch  the prime minister and cabinet is formed by the political party which gains a simple majority in the general elections held in barbados . these           years apart , however elections can be called whenever the government so chooses to seek a new mandate or loses a vote of no confidence in parliament . it is part of barbados  political system and supported by the public service .  ministries  **64;184456;span &amp;x5b ; edit table&amp;x5d ;  judicial branch  barbados  courts include the magistrates  court , high court , and court of appeal . it is also a member of the caribbean court of justice , and allows some appeals to the inter-american court of human rights .  perception  transparency international ranked barbados as 17th place in the world on its corruption perceptions index in 2010 , with only 1 nation scoring better in the americas .  see also  *politics of barbados *monarchy of barbados *parliament of barbados *prime minister of barbados *cabinet of barbados
genetically modified maize is a genetically modified crop . specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits , including resistance to pests and to herbicides . maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries . gm maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects , impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow . one strain , called starlink , was approved only for animal feed in the us , but was found in food , leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.  marketed products   herbicide resistant maize  corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by monsanto , and are known as roundup ready corn . they tolerate the use of roundup . bayer cropscience developed liberty link corn that is resistant to glufosinate . pioneer hi-bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark clearfield - though in these hybrids , the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen           framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for clearfield . as of 2011 , herbicide-resistant gm corn was grown in 14 countries . by 2012 , 26 varieties herbicide-resistant gm maize were authorised for import into the european union . in 2012 the eu was reported to import 30 million tons a year of gm crops , but such imports remain controversial . cultivation of herbicide-resistant corn in the eu provides substantial farm-level benefits .  insecticide-producing corn  bt corn is a variant of maize that has been genetically altered to express one or more proteins from the bacillus thuringiensis bacteria . the protein is poisonous to certain insect pests and is widely used in organic gardening . the european corn borer causes about a billion dollars in damage to corn crops each year . in recent years , traits have been added to ward off corn ear worms and root worms , the latter of which annually causes about a billion dollars in damages . the bt protein is expressed throughout the plant . when a vulnerable insect eats the bt-containing plant , the protein is           human gut is acidic ) . in the alkaline environment the protein partially unfolds and is cut by other proteins , forming a toxin that paralyzes the insect s digestive system and forms holes in the gut wall . the insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves . in 1996 , the first gm maize producing a bt cry protein was approved , which killed the european corn borer and related species ; subsequent bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae . bt genes that are approved include the following , singly and stacked : cry1a.105 , cryiab , cryif , cry2ab , cry3bb1 , cry34ab1 , cry35ab1 , mcry3a , and vip3a , in both corn and cotton . corn genetically modified to produce vip was first approved in the us in 2010.  drought resistance  in 2013 monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line           is provided by the insertion of the cspb gene from the soil microbe   bacillus subtilis   ; it was approved by the usda in 2011 and by china in 2013.   sweet corn   gm sweet corn varieties include attribute , the brand name for insect-resistant sweet corn developed by syngenta.  products in development  in 2007 , south african researchers announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to maize streak virus , although it has not been released as a product .  refuges  us environmental protection agency regulations require farmers who plant bt corn to plant non-bt corn nearby to provide a location to harbor vulnerable pests . the theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide . epa regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges , to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the epa . a study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above           corn farmers did not keep refuges properly , raising concerns that resistance would develop . unmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of bt corn in the us in 1996-2007 , because of the overall reduction of pest populations . this reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike .  resistance  resistant strains of the european corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management . in november 2009 , monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to first-generation bt cotton in parts of gujarat , india - that generation expresses one bt gene ,   cry1ac   . this was the first instance of bt resistance confirmed by monsanto anywhere in the world . bollworm resistance to first generation bt cotton has been identified in the australia , china , spain and the united states . in 2012 , a florida field trial demonstrated that army worms were resistant to pesticide-containing gm corn produced by dupont-dow ; armyworm resistance was first discovered in puerto rico in 2006 , prompting dow and dupont to voluntarily stop selling           of gm crops varies between countries , with some of the most-marked differences occurring between the usa and europe . regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses .  controversy  broad scientific consensus holds that food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food . the scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies . gm crops provide a number of ecological benefits , but there are also concerns for their overuse , stalled research outside of the bt seed industry , proper management and issues with bt resistance arising from their misuse . critics have objected to gm crops on ecological , economic and health grounds . the economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law , mostly patents . the first generation of gm crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015 . monsanto has claimed it will not to pursue farmers who retain seeds of off-patent           plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release . a 1999 study found that in a lab environment , pollen from bt maize dusted onto milkweed could harm the monarch butterfly . several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory , resulting in a risk assessment that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real-world conditions was negligible . a 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that the commercial large-scale cultivation of current btmaize hybrids did not pose a significant risk to the monarch population . a 2007 review found that nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in bt cotton and bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides . however , in comparison with insecticide-free control fields , certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in bt fields .  gene flow  gene flow is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another . concerns focus on the interaction between gm and other maize varieties in mexico , and of gene flow into refuges . in 2009 the government of mexico created a           is the center of diversity for maize , gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world s maize strains . a 2001 report in   nature   presented evidence that bt maize was cross-breeding with unmodified maize in mexico . the data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact .   nature   later stated , the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper . a 2005 large-scale study failed to find any evidence of contamination in oaxaca . however , other authors also found evidence of cross-breeding between natural maize and transgenic maize . a 2004 study found bt protein in kernels of refuge corn .  food  the french high council of biotechnologies scientific committee reviewed the 2009 vendmois   et al .   study and concluded that it .. presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological , hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed gmos . a 2011 canadian study looked at the presence of cryab1 protein in non-pregnant women ,           levels of the protein , including 93% of pregnant women and 80% of fetuses at concentrations of 0.19 0.30 and 0.04 0.04 mean sd ng/ml , respectively . the paper did not discuss safety implications or find any health problems . the paper was found to be unconvincing by multiple authors and organizations . in a swine model , cry1ab-specific antibodies were not detected in pregnant sows or their offspring and no negative effects from feeding bt maize to pregnant sows were observed . in january 2013 , the european food safety authority released all data submitted by monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance .  starlink corn recalls  starlink contains cry9c , which had not previously been used in a gm crop . starlink s creator , plant genetic systems had applied to the us environmental protection agency to market starlink for use in animal feed and in human food . starlink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the us , japan , and south korea . this corn became the subject           when taco bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn . sales of starlink seed were discontinued . the registration for starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by aventis in october 2000 . , which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to starlink . however , the cdc studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the starlink bt protein . a subsequent review of these tests by the federal insecticide , fungicide , and rodenticide act scientific advisory panel points out that while the negative results decrease the probability that the cry9c protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined .. in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay , it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this .           of the starlink bt proteins since 2001 . in 2005 , aid sent by the un and the us to central american nations also contained some starlink corn . the nations involved , nicaragua , honduras , el salvador and guatemala refused to accept the aid . in august 2013 , starlink corn was reported to be found in some foods in saudi arabia .  corporate espionage  on december 19 , 2013 six chinese citizens were indicted in iowa on charges of plotting to steal genetically modified seeds worth tens of millions of dollars to monsanto and dupont mo hailong , director of international business at the beijing dabeinong technology group co. , part of the beijing-based dbn group , was accused of stealing trade secrets after he was found digging in an iowa cornfield .  see also  * genetically modified food * genetically modified crops * genetically modified food controversies  references 
imageshield = dublin crest.svg county dublin is a county in ireland . it is sometimes officially referred to as the dublin region and is in the province of leinster . it is named after the city of dublin , which is the regional capital and the capital city of ireland . county dublin was one of the first parts of ireland to be shired by king john of england following the norman invasion of ireland . prior to 1994 county dublin was an administrative county run by a county council with functional area covering the whole county excluding the functional area of dublin city council . in 1994 dublin county council was abolished and replaced with three separate administrative county councils : dn laoghairerathdown , fingal and south dublin . the population of the county was 1,270,603 according to the census of 2011.  local government and politics  there are four local authorities whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of dublin . these are dublin city council , south dublin county           . there is also dublin regional authority which has authority over the while county but this body has few powers . it consists of 30 representatives who meet once per month . these representatives are nominated from the four administrative councils of the region . like each regional authority , it is assisted in its duties by an operational committee and eu operational committee . prior to the enactment of the local government act 1993 , the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities - dublin county council and dublin corporation . since the enactment of the local government act 2001 in particular , the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of county and a further entity at the level of city . they rank equally as first level local administrative units of the nuts 3 dublin region for eurostat purposes . there are 34 lau 1 entities in the republic of ireland . each local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation , planning and development , libraries ,           housing . the county is part of the dublin constituency for the purposes of european elections . for elections to dil ireann , the area of the county is today divided into twelve constituencies : dublin central , dublin midwest , dublin north , dublin northcentral , dublin northeast , dublin northwest , dublin south , dublin southcentral , dublin southeast , dublin southwest , dublin west and dn laoghaire . together they return 47 deputies

council , avril doyle td said , the bill before us today effectively abolishes county dublin , and as one born and bred in these parts of ireland i find it rather strange that we in this house are

edvard hagerup grieg was a norwegian composer and pianist . he is widely considered one of the leading romantic era composers , and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide . his use and development of norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of norway in the international spectrum , as well as helping develop a national identity , much as jean sibelius and antonn dvok did in finland and bohemia respectively .  biography  edvard hagerup grieg was born in bergen , norway , on 15 june 1843 . his parents were alexander grieg , a merchant and vice-consul in bergen ; and gesine judithe hagerup , a music teacher and daughter of edvard hagerup . the family name , originally spelled greig , has scottish origins . after the battle of culloden in 1746 , grieg s great-grandfather , alexander greig , traveled widely , settling in norway about 1770 , and establishing business interests in bergen . edvard grieg was raised in a           and taught him to play at the age of six . grieg studied in several schools , including tanks upper school , tanks school and the n.p.s , norwegian private school . in the summer of 1858 , grieg met the eminent norwegian violinist ole bull , who was a family friend ; bull s brother was married to grieg s aunt . bull recognized the 15-year-old boy s talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the leipzig conservatory , the piano department of which was directed by ignaz moscheles . grieg enrolled in the conservatory , concentrating on the piano , and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in leipzig . he disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study . an exception was the organ , which was mandatory for piano students . in the spring of 1860 , he survived a life-threatening lung disease , pleurisy and tuberculosis . throughout his life , grieg s health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine . he suffered from numerous respiratory infections , and ultimately developed combined lung and           and sanatoria both in norway and abroad . several of his doctors became his personal friends . in 1861 , grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in karlshamn , sweden . in 1862 , he finished his studies in leipzig and held his first concert in his home town , where his programme included beethoven s   pathtique   sonata . in 1863 , grieg went to copenhagen , denmark , and stayed there for three years . he met the danish composers j. p. e. hartmann and niels gade . he also met his fellow norwegian composer rikard nordraak , who became a good friend and source of inspiration . nordraak died in 1866 , and grieg composed a funeral march in his honor . on 11 june 1867 , grieg married his first cousin , nina hagerup . the next year , their only child , alexandra , was born . alexandra died in 1869 from meningitis . in the summer of 1868 , grieg wrote his piano concerto in a minor while on holiday in denmark           3 april 1869 in the casino theater in copenhagen . grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in christiania . in 1868 , franz liszt , who had not yet met grieg , wrote a testimonial for him to the norwegian ministry of education , which led to grieg s obtaining a travel grant . the two men met in rome in 1870 . on grieg s first visit , they went over grieg s violin sonata no. 1 , which pleased liszt greatly . on his second visit , in april , grieg brought with him the manuscript of his piano concerto , which liszt proceeded to sightread . liszt s rendition greatly impressed his audience , although grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly . liszt also gave grieg some advice on orchestration , . in 187476 , grieg composed incidental music for the             , at the request of the author . grieg had close ties with the bergen philharmonic orchestra , and later became music director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882 . in 1888 , grieg met tchaikovsky in leipzig . grieg was struck by the sadness in tchaikovsky. cite web grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates , first by cambridge university in 1894 and the next from oxford university in 1906.  later years  the norwegian government provided him with a pension . in the spring 1903 , grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in paris ; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both lps and cds , despite limited fidelity . grieg also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the hupfeld phonola piano-player system and welte-mignon reproducing system , all of which survive today and can be heard . he also worked with the aeolian company for its  autograph metrostyle  piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces . in 1906 , he met the composer and pianist           of grieg s music and a strong empathy was quickly established . in a 1907 interview , grieg stated : i have written norwegian peasant dances that no one in my country can play , and here comes this australian who plays them as they ought to be played ! he is a genius that we scandinavians can not do other than love . edvard grieg died in the late summer of 1907 , aged 64 , after a long period of illness . his final words were well , if it must be so . the funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him . following his wish , his own   funeral march in memory of rikard nordraak   was played in an orchestration by his friend johan halvorsen , who had married grieg s niece . in addition , the   funeral march   movement from chopin s piano sonata no. 2 was played . grieg was cremated , and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house , troldhaugen .           . edvard grieg and his wife considered themselves unitarians and nina went to the unitarian church in copenhagen after his death .  music  some of grieg s early works include a symphony and a piano sonata . he also wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata . grieg also composed the incidental music for henrik ibsen s play , peer gynt - which includes the famous excerpt entitled , in the hall of the mountain king . in this piece of music , the adventures of the anti-hero , peer gynt , are related , including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding . the angry guests chase him , and peer falls , hitting his head on a rock . he wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls . the music of in the hall of the mountain king represents the angry trolls taunting peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats . the music ends with peer escaping from the mountain . in an 1874 letter to his friend frants beyer , grieg expressed           , one of the movement he composed for peer gynt , writing i have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain king something that i literally ca nt bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies , exaggerated norwegian nationalism , and trollish self-satisfaction ! but i have a hunch that the irony will be discernible . grieg s   holberg suite   was originally written for the piano , and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra . grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets heinrich heine , johann wolfgang von goethe , henrik ibsen , hans christian andersen , rudyard kipling and others . russian composer nikolai myaskovsky used a theme by grieg for the variations with which he closed his third string quartet . norwegian pianist eva knardahl recorded the composer s complete piano music during 1978 and 1980 . the recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by bis records . grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907.  list of selected works  *piano sonata in           f major , op. 8 *concert overture   in autumn   , op. 11 *violin sonata no. 2 in g major , op. 13 *piano concerto in a minor , op. 16 *incidental music to bjrnstjerne bjrnson s play   sigurd jorsalfar   , op. 22 *incidental music to henrik ibsen s play   peer gynt   , op. 23 *   ballade in the form of variations on a norwegian folk song   in g minor , op. 24 *string quartet in g minor , op. 27 *   album for male chorus   , op. 30 *   two elegiac melodies for strings   , op. 34 *four   norwegian dances   for piano four hands , op. 35 *cello sonata in a minor , op. 36 *   holberg suite   for piano , later arr. for string orchestra , op. 40 *violin sonata no. 3 in c minor , op. 45 *   peer gynt   suite no. 1 , op. 46 *             orchestration of four   lyric pieces   ) *   peer gynt   suite no. 2 , op. 55 *suite from   sigurd jorsalfar   , op. 56 *four   symphonic dances   for piano , later arr. for orchestra , op. 64 *   haugtussa   song cycle after arne garborg , op. 67 *   sltter   for piano , op. 72 *sixty-six   lyric pieces   for piano in ten books , opp. 12 , 38 , 43 , 47 , 54 , 57 , 62 , 65 , 68 and 71 , including :   arietta   ,   to the spring   ,   little bird   ,   butterfly   ,   notturno   ,   wedding day at troldhaugen   ,   at your feet   ,   longing for home   ,   march of the dwarfs   ,   pome rotique   and      
in traditional belief and fiction , a ghost or specter , phantom , apparition or spook ) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear , in visible form or other manifestation , to the living . descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes , to realistic , lifelike visions . the deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy , or in spiritism as a   sance   . the belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread , dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures . certain religious practicesfuneral rites , exorcisms , and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magicare specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead . ghosts are generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular locations , objects , or people they were associated with in life , though stories of phantom armies ,           have also been recounted . the synonym   spook   is a dutch loanword , akin to low german   spk   ; it entered the english language via the united states in the 19th century . alternative words in modern usage include   spectre   , the scottish   wraith   ,   phantom   and   apparition   . the term   shade   in classical mythology translates greek , or latin   umbra   , in reference to the notion of spirits in the greek underworld . haint is a synonym for ghost used in regional english of the southern united states , and the haint tale is a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition . the term   poltergeist   is a german word , literally a noisy ghost           moving and influencing objects . an association with the verb   writhe   was the etymology favored by j. r. r. tolkien . tolkien s use of the word in the naming of the creatures known as the ringwraiths has influenced later usage in fantasy literature . bogey or   bogy/bogie   is a term for a ghost , and appears in scottish poet john mayne s   halloween   in 1780 . a   revenant   is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living , either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated corpse . also related is the concept of a fetch , the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive .  typology   anthropological context  a notion of the transcendent , supernatural or numinous , usually involving entities like ghosts , demons or deities , is a cultural universal . in pre-literate folk religions , these beliefs are often summarized under animism and ancestor worship . in many cultures malignant , restless ghosts are distinguished from           worship typically involves rites intended to prevent revenants , vengeful spirits of the dead , imagined as starving and envious of the living . strategies for preventing revenants may either include sacrifice , i.e. , giving the dead food and drink to pacify them , or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return . ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the chinese ghost festival or the western all souls  day . magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world s burial customs . the bodies found in many tumuli had been ritually bound before burial , and the custom of binding the dead persists , for example , in rural anatolia . nineteenth-century anthropologist james frazer stated in his classic work ,   the golden bough   , that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body .  ghosts and the afterlife  although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal , it appears to have been widely           body in every feature , even down to clothing the person wore . this is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures , including such works as the   egyptian book of the dead   , which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death , including the style of dress .  fear of ghosts  while deceased ancestors are universally regarded as venerable , and often imagined as having a continued presence in some sort of afterlife , the spirit of a deceased person which remains present in the material world is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or revenants is associated with a reaction of fear . this is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures , but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story , gothic horror , and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural .  common attributes  another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty , airy , or subtle material .           the person within the person , most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person s breath , which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist . this belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of breath in certain languages , such as the latin   spiritus   and the greek   pneuma   , which by analogy became extended to mean the soul . in the bible , god is depicted as synthesising adam , as a living soul , from the dust of the earth and the breath of god . in many traditional accounts , ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance , or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life . the appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death . seeing one s own ghostly double or fetch is a related omen of death . white ladies were reported to appear in many rural areas , and supposed to have died tragically or suffered           the world . common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fianc . they are often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a banshee . legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century ; most notable of these is the   flying dutchman   . this theme has been used in literature in   the rime of the ancient mariner   by coleridge .  locale  a place where ghosts are reported is described as haunted , and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property . supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building s past such as murder , accidental death , or suicide sometimes in the recent or ancient past . but not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death , or even on violent grounds . many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being           exist . some religious views argue that the  spirits  of those who have died have not  passed over  and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong .  history   ancient near east and egypt  **33;8401;!-- **401;8436;!-- there are many references to ghosts in mesopotamian religions the religions of sumer , babylon , assyria and other early states in mesopotamia . traces of these beliefs survive in the later abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region . the 5th-century bc play   oresteia   contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction .  roman empire and late antiquity  the ancient romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave . plutarch , in the 1st century ad , described the haunting of the baths at chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man . the ghosts loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up           a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by pliny the younger . pliny describes the haunting of a house in athens by a ghost bound in chains . the hauntings ceased when the ghost s shackled skeleton was unearthed , and given a proper reburial . the writers plautus and lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses . in the new testament , jesus has to persuade the disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection , luke 24:3739 . in a similar vein , jesus  followers at first believe him to be a ghost when they see him walking on water . one of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was lucian of samosata in the 2nd century ad . in his tale the doubter he relates how democritus the learned man from abdera in thrace lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not           how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by some young men of abdera who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him . this account by lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look . in the 5th century ad , the christian priest constantius of lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living , and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.  middle ages  ghosts reported in medieval europe tended to fall into two categories : the souls of the dead , or demons . the souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose . demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living . the living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of jesus christ . the soul of a dead person would divulge their mission , while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the holy name . most ghosts were           to atone for their transgressions in life . their penance was generally related to their sin . for example , the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue ; the ghost of another man , who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor , was condemned to wear the cloak , now heavy as a church tower . these ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering . other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths . medieval european ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the victorian age , and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession . some were less solid , and could move through walls . often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive , and dressed in tattered gray rags . the vast majority of reported sightings were male . there were           night in the forest , or in the remains of an iron age hillfort , as at wandlebury , near cambridge , england . living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights , which vanished when defeated . from the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211 , at the time of the albigensian crusade . gervase of tilbury , marshal of arles , wrote that the image of guilhem , a boy recently murdered in the forest , appeared in his cousin s home in beaucaire , near avignon . this series of visits lasted all of the summer . through his cousin , who spoke for him , the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished , until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly , leading to an extended disquisition on theology . the boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in purgatory , and reported that god was most pleased with the ongoing crusade against the cathar heretics , launched three years earlier . the time of the albigensian crusade           , this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy . haunted houses are featured in the 9th-century   arabian nights   .  european renaissance to romanticism  renaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult , including necromancy . in the era of the reformation and counter reformation , there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts , typified by writers such as thomas erastus . the swiss reformed pastor ludwig lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his   of ghosts and spirits walking by night .   the child ballad sweet william s ghost recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiance begging her to free him from his promise to marry her . he can not marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation . this reflects a popular british belief that           a new love without some formal release . the unquiet grave expresses a belief even more widespread , found in various locations over europe : ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living , whose mourning interferes with the dead s peaceful rest . in many folktales from around the world , the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man . soon after , he gains a companion who aids him and , in the end , the hero s companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man . instances of this include the italian fairy tale fair brow and the swedish the bird  grip  .  modern period of western culture   spiritualist movement  ----- editorial note ----- -- **379;8839;!-- spiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion , postulating a belief in god , but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by mediums , who can then provide information about the afterlife . by 1897 , it was said to have more than eight million followers           the middle and upper classes , while the corresponding movement in continental europe and latin america is known as spiritism . the religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion by periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . many prominent spiritualists were women . most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women s suffrage . by the late 1880s , credibility of the informal movement weakened , due to accusations of fraud among mediums , and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear . spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the united states and united kingdom .  spiritism  ---- editorial note ---- -- **376;9220;!-- spiritism , or french spiritualism , is based on the five books of the spiritist codification written by french educator hypolite lon denizard rivail under the pseudonym allan kardec reporting sances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence . his assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries           and studied the phenomena . his work was later extended by writers like leon denis , arthur conan doyle , camille flammarion , ernesto bozzano , chico xavier , divaldo pereira franco , waldo vieira , johannes greber and others . spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world , including spain , united states , canada , japan , germany , france , england , argentina , portugal and especially brazil , which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers .  scientific view  the physician john ferriar wrote   an essay towards a theory of apparitions   in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions . later the french physician alexandre jacques franois brire de boismont published   on hallucinations : or , the rational history of apparitions , dreams , ecstasy , magnetism , and somnambulism   in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations . david turner , a retired physical chemist , suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically .           that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead . according to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations . in a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings came to the conclusion that people consistently report unusual experiences in haunted areas because of environmental factors , which may differ across locations . some of these factors included the variance of local magnetic fields , size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware . some researchers , such as michael persinger of laurentian university , canada , have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields could stimulate the brain s temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings . sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings . richard lord and richard wiseman have           in a room , such as anxiety , extreme sorrow , a feeling of being watched , or even the chills . carbon monoxide poisoning , which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems , was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921.  by religion   judo-christian  the hebrew torah and the bible contain a few references to ghosts , associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities . the most notable reference is in the first book of samuel , in which a disguised king saul has the witch of endor summon the spirit/ghost of samuel . in the new testament , jesus has to persuade the disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection , luke 24:3739 . similarly , jesus  followers at first believe him to be a ghost when they see him walking on water . most of the christian church some ghosts are actually said to be demons in disguise           timothy 4:1 , that they come to deceive people and draw them away from god and into bondage . as a result , attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit , as was said to occur in the case of robbie mannheim , a fourteen-year-old maryland youth . the seventh-day adventist view is that a soul is not equivalent to spirit or ghost , and that save for the holy spirit , all spirits/ghosts are demons in disguise . furthermore , they teach that in accordance with , there are only two components to a soul , neither of which survives death - with each returning to its respective source . christadelphians reject the view of a living , conscious soul after death . the talmud tells of a being called a shade that is similar to other creatures in that it lives and dies but consists only of a form but lacks matter that forms mass , thus rendering it invisible . since it has no           end of the world to the other .  islam  according to islamic teachings , there are no such thing as ghosts . muslims believe that  ghosts  are in fact jinns . the koran discusses spirits known as jinns.  buddhism  in buddhism , there are a number of planes of existence into which a person can be reborn , one of which is the realm of hungry ghosts .  by culture   african folklore  the humr people of sudan consume the drink umm nyolokh ; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes . umm nyolokh often contains dmt and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as acacia ; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes , believed to be the giraffes ghosts by the humr.  european folklore  belief in ghosts in european folklore is characterized by the recurring fear of returning or   revenant   deceased who may harm the living . this includes the scandinavian   gjenganger   , the romanian   strigoi   , the serbian           vrykolakas   , etc . in scandinavian and finnish tradition , ghosts appear in corporeal form and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance . in fact , in many stories they are first mistaken for the living . they may be mute , appear and disappear suddenly , or leave no footprints or other traces . british folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations . belief in the soul and an afterlife remained near universal until the emergence of atheism in the 18th century . in the 19th century , spiritism resurrected belief in ghosts as the object of systematic inquiry , and popular opinion in western culture remains divided .  south and southeast asia   india  -- **378;9598;!-- a   bhoot   or   bhut   is a supernatural creature , usually the ghost of a deceased person , in the popular culture , literature and some ancient texts of the indian subcontinent . interpretations of how   bhoot   s come into existence vary by region and           and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on . this could be a violent death , unsettled matters in their lives , or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals . in central and northern india ,   aojha   spirit guides play a central role . it duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit to and that to a skondho kata which means a spirit without a head and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in central and northern india . it is also believed that if someone calls one from behind never turn back and see because the spirit may catch the human to make it a spirit . other types of spirits in hindu mythology include baital           possession of corpses , and pishacha , a type of flesh-eating demon .  austronesia  -- **378;9978;!-- there are many malay ghost myths , remnants of old animist beliefs that have been shaped by later hindu , buddhist and muslim influences in the modern states of indonesia , malaysia and brunei . some ghost concepts such as the female vampires pontianak and penanggalan are shared throughout the region . ghosts are a popular theme in modern malaysian and indonesian films . there are also many references to ghosts in filipino culture , ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the manananggal and tiyanak to more modern urban legends and horror films . the beliefs , legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the philippines . there was widespread belief in ghosts in polynesian culture , some of which persists today . after death , a person s ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld , but some could stay on earth . in many polynesian legends , ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living . ghosts might also cause sickness           be driven out through strong medicines . phi hua kat , phi pop , phi phong , phi phraya and mae nak has its origins in thai films that have now become classics . the most feared spirit in thailand is phi tai hong , the ghost of a person who has died suddenly of a violent death . the folklore of thailand also includes the belief that sleep paralysis is caused by a ghost , phi am.  tibet  ---- editorial note ---- -- **378;10358;!-- there is widespread belief in ghosts in tibetan culture . ghosts are explicitly recognized in the tibetan buddhist religion as they were in indian buddhism , occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one , and feature in many traditional legends . when a human dies , after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world . a hungry ghost has a tiny throat and huge stomach , and so can never be satisfied . ghosts           a spirit trap and burnt , thus releasing them to be reborn . ghosts may also be exorcised , and an annual festival is held throughout tibet for this purpose . some say that dorje shugden , the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk , is a deity , but the dalai lama asserts that he is an evil spirit , which has caused a split in the tibetan exile community .  americas   mexico  ---- editorial note ---- -- **378;10738;!-- there is extensive and varied belief in ghosts in mexican culture . the modern state of mexico before the spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the maya and aztec , and their beliefs have survived and evolved , combined with the beliefs of the spanish colonists . the day of the dead incorporates pre-columbian beliefs with christian elements . mexican literature and films include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living .  united states  according to the gallup poll news service , belief in haunted houses , ghosts , communication with the dead , and witches had an especially steep increase           about 32 percent of americans believe in ghosts .  depiction in the arts  ghosts are prominent in the popular cultures of various nations . the ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature .  renaissance to romanticism  one of the more recognizable ghosts in english literature is the shade of hamlet s murdered father in shakespeares   the tragical history of hamlet , prince of denmark   . in   hamlet   , it is the ghost who demands that prince hamlet investigate his murder most foul and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle , king claudius . in shakespeares   macbeth   , the murdered banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character . in english renaissance theater , ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor , as with the ghost of hamlets father . armor , being out-of-date by the time of the renaissance , gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity . but the sheeted           century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness : it clanked and creaked , and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators . these clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichd stage elements . ann jones and peter stallybrass , in   renaissance clothing and the materials of memory   , point out , in fact , it is as laughter increasingly threatens the ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of  spirit drapery  . an interesting observation by jones and stallybrass is that ghosts figured prominently in traditional british ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly the border ballads of the turbulent border country between england and scotland . ballads of this type include   the unquiet grave   ,   the wife of usher s well   , and   sweet william s ghost   , which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children . in the ballad   king           kings horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed . the king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman . one of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was   the castle of otranto   by horace walpole in 1764 . washington irving s short story   the legend of sleepy hollow   , based on an earlier german folktale , features a headless horseman . it has been adapted for film and television many times , such as   sleepy hollow   , a successful 1999 feature film .  victorian/edwardian  the classic ghost story arose during the victorian period , and included authors such as m. r. james , sheridan le fanu , violet hunt , and henry james . classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition , and contain elements of folklore and psychology . m. r. james summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as , malevolence and terror , the glare of evil faces , the stony           , and  long-drawn , distant screams  , are all in place , and so is a modicum of blood , shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded ... . famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of   a christmas carol   , in which ebenezer scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague jacob marley , and the ghosts of christmas past , christmas present and christmas yet to come . oscar wilde s comedy   the canterville ghost   has been adapted for film and television on several occasions . henry james s   the turn of the screw   has also appeared in a number of adaptations , notably the film   the innocents   and benjamin britten s opera   the turn of the screw   . oscar telgmann s opera   leo , the royal cadet   includes   judge s song   about a ghost at the royal military college of canada in kingston , ontario           things   is a 1904 collection of japanese ghost stories collected by lafcadio hearn , and later made into a film . in the united states , prior to and during the first world war , folklorists olive dame campbell and cecil sharp collected ballads from the people of the appalachian mountains , which included ghostly themes such as   the wife of usher s well   ,   the suffolk miracle   ,   the unquiet grave   , and   the cruel ship s carpenter   . the theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover . these songs were variants of traditional british ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the anglo-scottish border region .  modern era  professional parapsychologists and ghosts hunters , such as harry price , active in the 1920s and 1930s , and peter underwood , active in the 1940s and 1950s , published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as price s   the           s   ghosts of borley   . the writer frank edwards delved into ghost stories in his books of his , like stranger than science . childrens benevolent ghost stories became popular , such as casper the friendly ghost , created in the 1930s and appearing in comics , animated cartoons , and eventually a 1995 feature film . nol coward s play   blithe spirit   , later made into a film , places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations . with the advent of motion pictures and television , screen depictions of ghosts became common , and spanned a variety of genres ; the works of shakespeare , dickens and wilde have all been made into cinematic versions . novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema , although that of   the haunting of hill house   to   the haunting   in 1963 is an exception . sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror , and include             , which was later adapted to television with a successful 196870 tv series . genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944 s   the uninvited   , and 1945 s   dead of night   .  post-modern  the 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror . a common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger , often with unfinished business , such as 1989 s   field of dreams   , the 1990 film   ghost   , and the 1993 comedy   heart and souls   . in the horror genre , 1980 s   the fog   , and the   a nightmare on elm street   series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence . popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy   ghostbusters   , ghost           societies to explore reportedly haunted places . the ghost hunting theme has been featured in reality television series , such as   ghost adventures   ,   ghost hunters   ,   ghost hunters international   ,   ghost lab   ,   most haunted   and   a haunting   . it is also represented in children s television by such programs as   the ghost hunter   and   ghost trackers   . ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations , and ghost hunting how-to manuals . the 1990s saw a return to classic gothic ghosts , whose dangers were more psychological than physical . examples of films from this period include 1999 s   the sixth sense   and   the others   . asian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts , such as the 1998 japanese film   ringu   , and the pang           . indian ghost movies are popular not just in india , but in the middle east , africa , south east asia and other parts of the world . some indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film   chandramukhi   have been commercial successes , dubbed into several languages . - something later echoed by c. g. jung . nick harkaway considered that we all carry a host of ghosts in our heads , in the form of impressions of past acquaintances ghosts that represent our maps of other people in the world : our reference points . object relations theory sees our personalities as formed by splitting off aspects of ourselves we find incompatible ; whereupon we may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of our alternate selves .

officially the republic of latvia , is a country in the baltic region of northern europe , one of the three baltic states . it is bordered by estonia , lithuania , russia , belarus and by a maritime border to the west with sweden . latvia has 1,997,500 inhabitants and a territory of 64589km2 sqmi . the country has a temperate seasonal climate . latvia is a democratic parliamentary republic established in 1918 . the capital city is riga , the european capital of culture 2014 . latvian is the official language . latvia is a unitary state , divided into 118 administrative divisions of which 109 are municipalities and 9 are cities . there are five planning regions : kurzeme , latgale , riga , vidzeme and zemgale . the latvians are a baltic people , culturally related to the lithuanians . latvians and livs are           language ; it and lithuanian are the only two surviving baltic languages . despite foreign rule from the 13th to 20th centuries , the latvian nation maintained its identity throughout the generations via the language and musical traditions . latvia and estonia share a long common history . as a consequence of the soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic russians , some of whom are non-citizens . latvia is historically predominantly protestant lutheran , except for the latgale region in the southeast , which has historically been predominantly roman catholic . the republic of latvia was founded on 18 november 1918 . however , its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of world war ii . in 1940 , the country was forcibly incorporated into the soviet union , invaded and occupied by nazi germany in 1941 , and re-occupied by the soviets in 1944 to form the latvian ssr for the next fifty years . the peaceful singing revolution , starting in 1987 , called for baltic emancipation of soviet rule . it           , and latvia declared the restoration of its de facto independence on 21 august 1991 . latvia is a member of nato , european union , united nations , council of europe , cbss , imf , nb8 , nib , osce , and wto . it is currently in the accession process for joining the oecd . for 2013 , latvia is listed 44th on the human development index and as a high income country . it used the latvian lats as its currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 january 2014.  etymology  the name   latvija   is derived from the name of the ancient latgalians , one of four indo-european baltic tribes , which formed the ethnic core of modern latvians together with the finnic livonians.  history  around 3000 bce , the proto-baltic ancestors of the latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the baltic sea . the balts established trade routes to rome and byzantium , trading local amber for precious metals . by 900 ce , four           selonians , semigallians , as well as the livonians speaking a finnic language .  the medieval period  although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries , they were more fully integrated into european society in the 12th century . the first missionaries , sent by the pope , sailed up the daugava river in the late 12th century , seeking converts . the local people , however , did not convert to christianity as readily as hoped . german crusaders were sent into latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms . in the beginning of the 13th century , large parts of today s latvia were ruled by germans . together with southern estonia , these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as terra mariana or livonia . in 1282 , riga , and later the cities of csis ,           hanseatic league . and formed close cultural contacts with western europe .  the reformation period  the 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of latvia , including the reformation , the collapse of the livonian state , and the time when the latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers . after the livonian war , livonia fell under polish and lithuanian rule . the southern part of estonia and the northern part of latvia were ceded to the grand duchy of lithuania and formed into the   ducatus ultradunensis   . gotthard kettler , the last master of the order of livonia , formed the duchy of courland and semigallia . though the duchy was a vassal state to poland , it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century . latgalia , the easternmost region of latvia , became a part of the polish district of inflanty . the 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the           the eastern baltic . after the polishswedish war , northern livonia came under swedish rule . riga became the capital of swedish livonia and the largest city in the entire swedish empire . fighting continued sporadically between sweden and poland until the truce of altmark in 1629 . in latvia , the swedish period is generally remembered as positive ; serfdom was eased , a network of schools was established for the peasantry , and the power of the regional barons was diminished . several important cultural changes occurred during this time . under swedish and largely german rule , western latvia adopted lutheranism as its main religion . the ancient tribes of the couronians , semigallians , selonians , livs and northern latgallians assimilated to form the latvian people , speaking one latvian language . throughout all the centuries , however , no such thing as a latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective . meanwhile , largely isolated from the rest of latvia , southern latgallians adopted catholicism under polish/jesuit influence           many polish and russian loanwords.  latvia in the russian empire  the capitulation of estonia and livonia in 1710 and the treaty of nystad , ending the great northern war in 1721 , gave vidzeme to russia , up to 40 per cent of latvians died from famine and plague . half the residents of riga were killed by plague in 17101711 . the promises peter the great made to the baltic german nobility at the fall of riga in 1710 , confirmed by the treaty of nystad and known as the capitulations , largely reversed the swedish reforms . peter seriously considered moving russian capital into riga and visited riga for several long stays . curiously , peter the great s wife marta was the only           the serfs took place in courland in 1817 and in vidzeme in 1819 . in practice , however , the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility , as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation , forcing them to return to work at the estates of their own free will . during the 19th century , the social structure changed dramatically . a class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land , but many landless peasants remained . there also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential latvian bourgeoisie . the young latvian movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century , many of its leaders looking to the slavophiles for support against the prevailing german-dominated social order . the rise in use of the latvian language in literature and society became known as the first national awakening . russification began in latgale after the polish led the january uprising in 1863 : this spread to the rest of what is now latvia by the 1880s . the young latvians were largely           and political movement , in the 1890s . popular discontent exploded in the 1905 russian revolution , which took a nationalist character in the baltic provinces . during these two centuries latvia experienced economic and construction boom ports were expanded , railways built ; new factories , banks and university were established ; many residential , public and school buildings erected ; new parks formed ; etc . riga s boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the old town date from this period .  declaration of independence  world war i devastated the territory of what would become the state of latvia , including other western parts of the russian empire . demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy , but the russian 1917 revolution , treaty with germany at brest-litovsk , and allied armistice with germany on 11 november 1918 , created a power vacuum . the people s council of latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in riga on 18 november 1918 , with krlis ulmanis becoming           independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in eastern europe . by the spring of 1919 , there were actually three governmentsulmanis s government ; the latvian soviet government led by pteris stuka , whose forces , supported by the red army , occupied almost all of the country ; and the baltic german government of the united baltic duchy , headed by andrievs niedra and supported by the baltische landeswehr and the german freikorps unit   iron division   . estonian and latvian forces a freely elected constituent assembly convened on 1 may 1920 , and adopted a liberal constitution , the   satversme   , in february 1922 . the constitution was partly suspended by krlis ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990 . since then , it has been amended and is still in effect in latvia today . with most of latvia s industrial base evacuated to the interior of russia in 1915 , radical land reform was the central political question for the young state . in 1897 , 61.2%           , that percentage had been reduced to 18% . by 1923 , the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level . innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy , but it soon suffered from the effects of the great depression . latvia showed signs of economic recovery , and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period . on 15 may 1934 , ulmanis staged a bloodless coup , establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940 . after 1934 , ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of latvianising the economy .  latvia in world war ii  early in the morning of 24 august 1939 , the soviet union and nazi germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact , called the molotovribbentrop pact . the pact contained a secret protocol , revealed only after germany s defeat in 1945 , according to which the states of northern and eastern europe were divided into german and soviet spheres of influence . in the north , latvia , finland and estonia were assigned to the soviet sphere           respective portions of poland . after the conclusion of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , most of the baltic germans left latvia by agreement between ulmanis  government and nazi germany under the heim ins reich programme . in total 50,000 baltic germans left by the deadline of december 1939 , with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in latvia . most of those who remained left for germany in summer 1940 , when a second resettlement on 5 october 1939 , latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the soviet union , granting the soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on latvian territory . after staging border incidents , on 16 june 1940 the government of the ussr handed the latvian ambassador in moscow a note , in which latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 october 1939 , and demands were made for sending in additional soviet troops and to change the government . the latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force . on 17 june soviet troops invaded latvian territory . in           soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning . this is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government , which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between latvia and the soviet union . it is , therefore , my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units .. the government has resigned . i shall remain in my place , you remain in yours .  no opposition was shown towards the soviet forces ; on the contrary , part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm , which was heavily exploited by soviet propaganda . the well known russian lawyer and public figure of latvia , pyotr yakobi , wrote :  taken from the german model , the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy , having satisfied a limited circle of citizens , who have adapted themselves to the state pie . clearly , any hardship is not in vain . and so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return           those unhappy with the regime of krlis ulmanis included people who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and had no desire to end up under nazi german rule . state administrators were liquidated and replaced by soviet cadres , in which 34,250 latvians were deported or killed . elections were held with single pro-soviet candidates listed for many positions . the resulting people s assembly immediately requested admission into the ussr , which the soviet union granted . latvia , then a puppet government , was headed by augusts kirhenteins . the soviet union incorporated latvia on 5 august 1940 , as the   latvian soviet socialist republic .   the soviets dealt harshly with their opponents prior to the german invasion , in less than a year , at least 27,586 people were arrested . most were deported for cooperating with the german army , and about 945 were shot . under german occupation , latvia was administered as part of   reichskommissariat ostland   . latvian paramilitary and auxiliary police units established by the occupation authority participated in the holocaust as well . more           including approximately 75,000 latvian jews murdered during the nazi occupation . latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict , including in the latvian legion of the waffen-ss , most of them conscripted by the occupying nazi and soviet authorities .  soviet era  in 1944 , when soviet military advances reached the area , heavy fighting took place in latvia between german and soviet troops , which ended in another german defeat . in the course of the war , both occupying forces conscripted latvians into their armies , in this way increasing the loss of the nation s live resources . in 1944 , part of the latvian territory once more came under soviet control . the soviets immediately began to reinstate the soviet system . after the german surrender , it became clear that soviet forces were there to stay , and latvian national partisans , soon joined by german collaborators , began to fight against the new occupier . anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 latvians took refuge from the soviet army by fleeing to germany and sweden           , with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the soviets or , during few months immediately after the end of war , returned by the west . the soviets reoccupied the country in 19441945 , and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and sovieticised . on 25 march 1949 , 43,000 rural residents and latvian patriots were deported to siberia in a sweeping operation priboi in all three baltic states , which was carefully planned and approved in moscow already on 29 january 1949 . an extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in latvia , limiting the use of latvian language in official uses in favour of using russian as the main language . all of the minority schools were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools : latvian and russian . an influx of labourers , administrators , military personnel and their dependants from russia and other soviet republics started . by 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other soviet republics           since latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists , moscow decided to base some of the soviet union s most advanced manufacturing in latvia . new industry was created in latvia , including a major machinery factory raf in jelgava , electrotechnical factories in riga , chemical factories in daugavpils , valmiera and olaineand some food and oil processing plants . latvia manufactured trains , ships , minibuses , mopeds , telephones , radios and hi-fi systems , electrical and diesel engines , textiles , furniture , clothing , bags and luggage , shoes , musical instruments , home appliances , watches , tools and equipment , aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods . latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory . however , there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories . to maintain and expand industrial production , skilled workers were migrating from all over the soviet union , decreasing the proportion of ethnic latvians in the republic . population of latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people .           half of the 1980s , soviet leader mikhail gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the soviet union that were called glasnost and perestroika . in the summer of 1987 , the first large demonstrations were held in riga at the freedom monumenta symbol of independence . in the summer of 1988 , a national movement , coalescing in the popular front of latvia , was opposed by the interfront . the latvian ssr , along with the other baltic republics was allowed greater autonomy , and in 1988 , the old pre-war flag of latvia flew again , replacing the soviet latvian flag as the official flag in 1990 . in 1989 , the supreme soviet of the ussr adopted a resolution on the   occupation of the baltic states   , in which it declared the occupation not in accordance with law , and not the will of the soviet people . pro-independence popular front of latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the supreme council in the march 1990 democratic elections . on 4 may 1990 , the supreme soviet of the latvian ssr           republic of latvia , and the latvian ssr was renamed republic of latvia . however , the central power in moscow continued to regard latvia as a soviet republic in 1990 and 1991 . in january 1991 , soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the republic of latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in riga and establishing a committee of national salvation to usurp governmental functions . during the transitional period , moscow maintained many central soviet state authorities in latvia . in spite of this , 73% of all latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 march 1991 , in a nonbinding advisory referendum . the popular front of latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for latvian citizenship . however , universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted . a majority of ethnic non-latvians did not receive latvian citizenship . many of them were born in latvia , but still became non-citizens . by 2011 , more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received latvian citizenship . still , today there are 290,660 non-citizens in           no citizenship of any country , and can not vote in latvia . the republic of latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 august 1991 , in the aftermath of the failed soviet coup attempt . the saeima , latvia s parliament , was again elected in 1993 . russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the skrunda-1 radar station in 1998 . the major goals of latvia in the 1990s , to join nato and the european union , were achieved in 2004 . language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many russophones . citizenship was not automatically extended to former soviet citizens who settled during the soviet occupation , or to their offspring . children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship . approximately 72% of latvian citizens are latvian , while 20% are russian ; less than 1% of non-citizens are latvian , while 71% are russian . the government denationalised private property confiscated by the soviet rule , returning it or compensating the owners for           prewar currency . albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its re-orientation

nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology . nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials , to nanoelectronic biosensors , and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology . current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials . nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the us national institutes of health . of note is the funding in 2005 of a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers . in april 2006 , the journal nature materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide .  overview  the biological and medical research communities have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications . terms such as   biomedical nanotechnology   ,   nanobiotechnology   , and   nanomedicine   are used to describe this hybrid field . functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by           of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures ; therefore , nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications . thus far , the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices , contrast agents , analytical tools , physical therapy applications , and drug delivery vehicles . nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future . the national nanotechnology initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems , new therapies , and in vivo imaging . neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research . further down the line , the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field . nanomedicine is a large industry , with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004 , and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide , a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology r&amp;d is being invested every year . as the nanomedicine industry           significant impact on the economy .  medical use of nanomaterials  two forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer , and using liposomes as vaccine adjuvants and as vehicles for drug transport . similarly , drug detoxification is also another application for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats . a benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body , plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter . these devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery . advances in lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications .  drug delivery  nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles . the overall drug consumption and side-effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed . this highly selective approach would           found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials . another example is to use block co-polymers , which form micelles for drug encapsulation . they could hold small drug molecules transporting them to the desired location . another vision is based on small electromechanical systems ; nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs . some potentially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells . targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses . the increased efficiency of delivery results in overall societal benefit by reducing the amount of drug needed in an equipotent preparation of said therapy , and thus reduced cost to the consumer . nanomedical approaches to drug delivery center on developing nanoscale particles or molecules to improve drug bioavailability . bioavailability refers to the presence of drug molecules where they are needed in the body and where they will do the most good . drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time . this can potentially be achieved by           targeting the molecules and delivering drugs with cell precision . more than $65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability .   in vivo   imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed . using nanoparticle contrast agents , images such as ultrasound and mri have a favorable distribution and improved contrast . the new methods of nanoengineered materials that are being developed might be effective in treating illnesses and diseases such as cancer . what nanoscientists will be able to achieve in the future is beyond current imagination . this might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect , evaluate , treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically . drug delivery systems , lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles , can be designed to improve the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of drugs . the strength of drug delivery systems is their ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug . however , the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients . when designed to avoid the body s defence mechanisms , nanoparticles have beneficial properties           larger particles would have been cleared from the body , cells take up these nanoparticles because of their size . complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed , including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm . efficiency is important because many diseases depend upon processes within the cell and can only be impeded by drugs that make their way into the cell . triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently . drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal . for example , a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist , improving the solubility . also , a drug may cause tissue damage , but with drug delivery , regulated drug release can eliminate the problem . if a drug is cleared too quickly from the body , this could force a patient to use high doses , but with drug delivery systems clearance can be reduced by altering the pharmacokinetics of the drug . poor biodistribution is a problem           the particulates from drug delivery systems lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue . potential nanodrugs will work by very specific and well-understood mechanisms ; one of the major impacts of nanotechnology and nanoscience will be in leading development of completely new drugs with more useful behavior and less side effects . polymeric nano-particles are a competing technology to lipidic nano-particles . there is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studied or understood . this toxicity could include hepatotoxicity , nephrotoxicity etc. and can have long term impacts not easily evaluated in short term in-vivo clinical trials either in animals or humans . since the degradation of polymers to either their monomers or other degradation products in the body can not be accurately predicted , this is a real risk , specially in medicines intended for long term patient use . even if the toxicity is ignored , there is additional hepatic load of metabolism , again an area of concern for long term medication           cost and predictable characterisation , so the formulation chemists prefer this . however , in the patient s body this very stability is a negative factor . phospholipids on the other hand are membrane lipids , have a gras status from fda and are derived from natural sources without any complex chemistry involved . they are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the degradation products are themselves nutrients . it is greatly observed that nanoparticles are promising tools for the advancement of drug delivery , medical imaging , and as diagnostic sensors . however , the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host s reactions to nano- and microsized materials 14 and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body . nevertheless , a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems . for example , current research in the excretory systems of mice           organs based on their size and charge . these composites are encapsulated by a dendrimer and assigned a specific charge and size . positively-charged gold nanoparticles were found to enter the kidneys while negatively-charged gold nanoparticles remained in the liver and spleen . it is suggested that the positive surface charge of the nanoparticle decreases the rate of opsonization of nanoparticles in the liver , thus affecting the excretory pathway . even at a relatively small size of 5 nm , though , these particles can become compartmentalized in the peripheral tissues , and will therefore accumulate in the body over time . while advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles , the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses . nanoparticles are also used to circumvent multidrug resistance mechanisms . mechanisms of mdr include decreased uptake of drugs , reduced intracellular drug concentration by activation of the efflux transporters , modifications in cellular pathways by altering cell cycle checkpoints , increased metabolism of drugs , induced emergency response genes to impair apoptotic pathways           research studies  *abraxane , approved by the u.s. food and drug administration to treat breast cancer , non-small- cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer , is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel. *doxil was originally approved by the fda for the use on hiv-related kaposi s sarcoma . it is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma . the drug is encased in liposomes , which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed . liposomes are self-assembling , spherical , closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space . the liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically . *in a mice study , scientists from rice university and university of texas md anderson cancer center reported enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity of an existing treatment for head and neck cancer when using the nanoparticles to deliver the drug . the hydrophilic carbonic clusters functionalized with polyethylene glycol or peg-hcc are mixed with the chemotherapeutic           receptor targeted cetuximab and injected intravenously . they found the tumors were killed more effectively with radiation and the healthy tissue suffered less toxicity than without the nanotechnology drug delivery . the standard treatment contains cremophor el which allows the hydrophobic paclitaxel to be delivered intravenously . replacing the toxic cremophor with carbon nanoparticles eliminated its side effect and improved drug targeting which in turn required a lower dose of the toxic paclitaxel. *researchers at case western reserve university reported using nanoparticle chain to deliver doxorubicin to breast cancer cells in a mice study . three magnetic , iron-oxide nanospheres were chemically linked to one doxorubicin-loaded liposome and formed a 100 nm long nanoparticle chain . after the nanochains penetrated the tumor , radiofrequency field was generated that caused the magnetic nanoparticles to vibrate and rupture the liposome , dispersing the drug in its free form throughout the tumor . the result showed that the nano treatment was more effective in halting tumor growth than the standard treatment with doxorubicin . it is also less harmful to healthy cells since only 5% to 10% of the standard dose           carrying payload of antibiotics at its core could swift charge thus allowing them to target bacterial infection more precisely inside the body , a group of mit researchers reported . the nanoparticles , containing a sub-layer of ph sensitive chains of the amino acid histidine , carry a slightly negative charge when circulating in the blood stream , can evade detection and clearing by the immune system . when they encounter an infection site the particles gain a positive charge provoked by the slightly acidic environment at the infection sites , allowing them to bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and release antibiotics at locally high concentration . this nano delivery system can potentially destroy bacteria even if it has developed resistance to antibiotics because of the targeted high dose and prolonged release of the drug . although a lot of work is still needed , the researchers believe that it points to a new direction of using nanotechnology to treat infectious disease . *using the biomimetic strategy , researchers in the harvard university wyss institute demonstrated in a mouse model that the drug coated nanoparticles           regions in the blood vessels just like the platelets do . aggregates of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with tissue plasminogen activator , each about the size of a platelet , were injected intravenously . in the region of vessel narrowing , shear stresses dissociate the aggregates and release the tpa-coated nanoparticles which bind and degrade the blood clots . by prcised targeting and concentrating drug at the location of obstruction , the dose used is less than 1/50th of the normal dose . the nanotherapeutics will greatly reduce the severe side effect of bleeding , commonly found in standard treatment of thrombosis . *an early phase clinical trial using the platform of minicell nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer . built from the membranes of mutant bacteria , the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab , antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor which is often overexpressed in a number of cancers , as a  homing  device to the tumor cells . the tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells           engulf it . once inside , the payload of anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells . measured at 400 nanometers , the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery . the researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver , digestive system and skin . this phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients . as a platform technology , the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects . *researchers at the methodist hospital research institute in houston have created  leukolike vectors  or llvs . llvs are the drug-carrying silicon nanoparticles coated with the lipoprotein removed from the membranes of the white blood cells , leukocytes . the  cloaked  nanoparticles were found to behave like leukocytes , are able to evade the body s immune system and survive much longer           . the scientists expressed that llvs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by avoiding clearance in blood stream , crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissues due to its leukocyte like characters . synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte. *inhalable nanocarriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system . the lipid nanoparticles contain the drug payload ; two types of small interfering rna ; and the targeting molecules , an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone which homes in the overexpressed receptors of the cancer cells . the disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer . results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment . *self-powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled           ion gradients generated by leaked minerals from the bone , and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing . using a model system of human tibia and femur , researchers from pennsylvania state university and boston university used nanoparticles of polylactic-coglycolic acid carrying sodium alendronate for the   in vitro   experiments and found the  nanotrucks  successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone . *nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule . clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50-100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload . experiments by researchers in northwestern university on mouse models with chemotherapy-resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone . the nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer           and , once inside the tumor , the nanoparticles are retained much longer . additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple-negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin . increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models . ucla reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine . the nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears . the drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down . *in regenerative medicine research , silica based nanoparticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells . using a mouse model , scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant   in vivo   . *nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel           to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model . researchers in the north carolina state university designed this nanoparticle , called gelipo , to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both . the cross-linked hyaluronic acid shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide . ha preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes . when the haase degrades the gel shell of gelipo , the trail protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis . the core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes , the cellular transport system . the peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly , maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects .  protein and peptide delivery  protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders . these macromolecules are           using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics , and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals.  applications and reported research studies  *nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis . biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse s immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system . team of researchers in northwestern university indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases . *researchers at ucla developed a nanoparticle system with water-soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus , apoptin . apoptin selectively sends self-destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death as it builds up in the nucleus , while leaving healthy cells unharmed . in the mouse model of human breast cancer , the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth . this new form of treatment           harming healthy cells , a common pitfall of chemotherapy , and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy . *a nano-network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin , modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days . the nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan or negatively charged alginate . the opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano-network even after they are injected subcutaneously . the porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores . when there is high blood sugar level , glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid . the disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range .  cancer  the small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology , particularly in imaging . quantum dots , can produce exceptional images of tumor sites . these nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation . this means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today s organic dyes used as contrast media . the downside , however , is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements . another nanoproperty , high surface area to volume ratio , allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle , which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells . additionally , the small size of nanoparticles , allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites . research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect , image , and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way . a promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials . kanzius rf therapy           inside the body with radio waves that heat only the nanoparticles and the adjacent cells . sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires , able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells , could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient s blood . the basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts : a ) efficient encapsulation of the drugs , b ) successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body , and c ) successful release of that drug there . researchers at rice university under prof. jennifer west , have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice . the nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface . by irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser , which passes through flesh without heating it , the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells . limitations to           , and lack of solubility . nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems . nanoparticles of cadmium selenide glow when exposed to ultraviolet light . when injected , they seep into cancer tumors . the surgeon can see the glowing tumor , and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal . in photodynamic therapy , a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside . the light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal , energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue . light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them . this therapy is appealing for many reasons . it does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist . photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases , growth and tumors           numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform , by targeting specific tumor cells , tissues and organs . actually , conde et al . reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic sirna silencing via rgd-nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model . this study reported the use of sirna/rgd gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models , resulting in successful and significant   c-myc   oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals . this delivery system can achieve translocation of sirna duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression . actually , rgd/sirna-aunps can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3-receptor-mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity , showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered   c-myc   sirna to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis.  surgery  at rice university , a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece . the two pieces of chicken are placed           dribbled along the seam . an infrared laser is traced along the seam , causing the two sides to weld together . this could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant . the flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly .  visualization  tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized . it is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body , so scientists used to dye the cells . these dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up . while different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light , there was a need for as many light sources as cells . a way around this problem is with luminescent tags . these tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes . the dots can be random in size , can be made of bio-inert material , and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size-dependent           the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce . then both groups can be lit with a single light source . they have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble .  tissue engineering  nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue . tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors . for example , bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds . tissue engineering might replace today s conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants . advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension . artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates.  antimicrobial effects  nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties . it has been shown that zinc oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic           in vitro . nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs . another example is silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds . antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry.  immune response  buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy/immune response by preventing mast cells from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues , by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti-oxidant currently available , such as vitamin e . in february 2013 , university of pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response ; which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future . this is done by using the protein cd47 , found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the sirpa in macrophages ; preventing an immune response from being triggered .  arthroscope  nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes , which are pencil-sized devices that           can do the surgeries with smaller incisions . the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients . it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a

of the data scriptstyle x and the network s output , scriptstyle f . the cost function is dependent on the task . as a trivial example , consider the model scriptstyle f = a where scriptstyle a is a constant and the cost scriptstyle c=e 2 . minimizing this cost will give us a value of scriptstyle a that is equal to the mean of the data . the cost function can be much more complicated . its form depends on the application : for example , in compression it could be related to the mutual information between scriptstyle x and scriptstyle f , whereas in statistical modeling , it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data . . tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems ; the applications include clustering , the estimation of statistical distributions , compression and filtering .  reinforcement learning            usually not given , but generated by an agent s interactions with the environment . at each point in time scriptstyle t , the agent performs an action scriptstyle yt and the environment generates an observation scriptstyle xt and an instantaneous cost scriptstyle ct , according to some dynamics . the aim is to discover a   policy   for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost ; i.e. , the expected cumulative cost . the environment s dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown , but can be estimated . more formally the environment is modelled as a markov decision process with states scriptstyle s1 , ... , snin s and actions

scriptstyle p , while a policy is defined as conditional           the two then define a markov chain . the aim is to discover the policy that minimizes the cost ; i.e. , the mc for which the cost is minimal . anns are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm . dynamic programming has been coupled with anns by bertsekas and tsitsiklis and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing , natural resources management or medicine because of the ability of anns to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems . tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems , games and other sequential decision making tasks .  learning algorithms  training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost criterion . there are numerous algorithms available for training neural network models ; most of them           and statistical estimation . most of the algorithms used in training artificial neural networks employ some form of gradient descent . this is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction . evolutionary methods , these networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer . the diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient . the models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables . colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks . neural networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with more accuracy than the current clinical methods . after training , the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions .  neural networks and neuroscience  theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems . since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behavior , the field is closely related to           is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work . to gain this understanding , neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes , biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning and theory .  types of models  many models are used in the field , defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems . they range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons , models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems . these include models of the long-term , and short-term plasticity , of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level .  neural network software  neural network software is used to simulate , research , develop and apply artificial neural networks , biological neural networks and , in some           types of artificial neural networks  artificial neural network types vary from those with only one or two layers of single direction logic , to complicated multiinput many directional feedback loops and layers . on the whole , these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of their functions . most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying connections to the neurons . artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from outside teachers or even self-teaching from written-in rules .  theoretical properties   computational power  the multi-layer perceptron is a universal function approximator , as proven by the cybenko theorem . however , the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of the weights . work by hava siegelmann and eduardo d. sontag has provided a proof that a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights has the full power of a universal turing machine to detecting credit card fraud . technology writer roger bridgman commented           networks , for instance , are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven , but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked : the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque , unreadable table ... valueless as a scientific resource . in spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology , dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers . an unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having .  in response to this kind of criticism , one should note that although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult , it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network . furthermore , researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to           2007 ) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning , as well as shallow vs deep architecture . some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models . they advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind . **22;70143;gallery

obelix is a cartoon character from the french comic book series asterix . he works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman , and is asterix s best friend . obelix is noted for his fatness , the menhirs he carries around on his back and his superhuman strength . he is the only gaul in asterix s village who is permanently superhumanly strong since he fell into a cauldron of magic potion when he was a baby . because of obelix s already enormous strength , he is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again , a ban he regards as being tremendously unfair . other characteristics are his simplemindedness , his love and care for his dog dogmatix , his anger when someone refers to him as being   fat   , his enthusiasm for hunting and eating wild boars and beating up romans . his catchphrase is :   ils sont fous ces romains   , which translates into they are crazy , those romans ! , although he considers nearly every other nationality to           actor grard depardieu in every asterix live-action movie .  fatness inspection  he is a large man who does not see himself as fat , preferring to call himself   well covered   or having a chest that has slipped a bit . from   asterix and the banquet   onwardspreviously he had simply expressed ignorance of being fat , such as when he merely commented that he wished he had known he was too fat to pose as a lion in   asterix the gladiator   obelix is so in denial over this matter that he usually does not even notice when other people refer to him as that fat one , and often shows total confusion over which fat person people are referring to . when he does understand the allusions are made on his behalf he flies into a rage and starts beating up the person who said it . sometimes , when he is in a bad mood , just hearing the word fat even if it is not in reference to himcan quickly enrage him .           , is one of the main causes of conflicts between asterix and obelix which leads to more developing conflicts in which they must work together , once escalating to the point that obelix actually gave asterix amnesia when he hit him too hard during an argument . although they usually simply insult each other verbally they inevitably make up swiftly . sometimes , obelix can be so paranoic over the allusion of the word   fat   that he can even break the fourth wall with the mere mention of this . visibly in asterix and the black gold , when the narrator points out that their vessel was pulled like a   big and fat fish   , obelix became clearly offended and yelled   who is fat ! ?   .  character  obelix is asterix s closest friend . obelix has a little dog named dogmatix , whom he adores . his parents live now in condate and his distant cousin metallurgix , a golden sickle maker , lives in lutetia . obelix s favourite food is roast wild boar which he usually hunts with asterix , but he has a voracious appetite , and will try eating nearly anything with few exceptions ; in   asterix and obelix all at sea   and   asterix in britain   he seems to not like boiled boar . in fact , he eats nuts and oysters in the shell , and is completely oblivious to drugs , spicy food and poison ,           . however , when he consumes alcohol , he gets very drunk very quickly , as seen for example in   asterix in britain   where he enjoys sampling different barrels of wine trying to find a barrel containing magic potion , or in   asterix and the laurel wreath   , where both he and chief vitalstatistix get drunk during a banquet , much to shame of the latter s wife impedimenta . although he has his own house , obelix is occasionally shown staying overnight at asterix s . obelix owns the quarry where he chisels the menhirs himself . it is never directly stated what the menhirs are used for , though it is hinted that they are just oversized knick-knacks ; however they are probably a running-gag regarding the origins of the mystery surrounding menhirs in ancient europe , with the joke being that obelix delivered them . obelix usually trades the stones away for whatever he needs , resulting in the village having a literal field of menhirs . obelix is kind-hearted , but socially inept possibly because his strength means that           . he is still not completely aware of his own strength and almost invariably breaks any door he   gently   knocks on . he is frequently used as a   human battering ram   for opening locked doors or breaking through walls . similarly , he is unaware that others do not share his superhuman strength , and shows great surprise when others are crushed by what he calls   a little menhir   , or when asterix attempts to explain to him that a small dog like dogmatix can not lift a menhir . he also has little interest in subjects of formal education or intellectual pursuits , since sheer strength usually solves his problems ; he generally leaves any decisions to asterix . however , obelix is not completely stupid . in   asterix and the normans   he deduces from various clues that cacofonix the bard has gone to lutetia to pursue a career in popular music : this unusual display of intelligence on obelix s part surprises getafix . he also surprises asterix in   asterix and           definition of wild boar in conversation . he can also be quite dangerous when angered . while cheerfully violent and enjoying a good fight , obelix is far from brutal or sadistic : he tends to view fighting as a game and is generally friendly and polite towards his opponents . he extends this benevolence even towards the romans , whom he rarely seems to view as oppressors but more as less-willing participants in his rough-housing . his other favored pastimes are dancing , and occasionally drinking goat s milk to excess . like asterix , obelix is a bachelor , but he is easily smitten by a pretty face . he harbours a hopeless crush on panacea , the daughter of soporifix , and occasionally other young women , most notably mrs. geriatrix . however , one may think that he will eventually find a           the class act   , he is shown to be the founder of a long dynasty of french warriors that lasted well into the 20th century . obelix s trademark phrase is these romans are crazy , which annoys obelix greatly . . however , in   asterix and cleopatra ,   getafix gives him a few drops to open a door in the great pyramid s labyrinth but he comments that he does not see much difference between before and after the potion though this is presumably because obelix is used to accomplishing any physical task with ease . although it has been clearly stated by both getafix and asterix that the magic potion does not grant invulnerability as well as superhuman strength , meaning that they   could             raw strength generally prevents the romans getting the chance to do so , the same does not seem to be true of obelix ; he does not even notice when attackers attempt to knock him unconscious with blows to the head , when roman spearheads are stuck in his bottom in   asterix in corsica   or when anyone else attempts to harm him in any way . this may imply that obelix , either by stupidity or ignorance , simply does not notice or react to the pain that should be inflicted , or that the potion has enhanced his overall strength , since it has been shown to increase the drinker s endurance allowing them to run faster , to such a point where his muscles allow him to effortlessly absorb the attacks in question . most of the occasions where obelix demonstrates invulnerability include him being attacked physically rather than with sharp objects , as in asterix and the magic carpet , when an arrow accidentally hits his bottom and he yells in agony , and thus showing that obelix is nt above physical pain )           it comes to the relationship between the gauls and the romans . as far as he is concerned the more romans he can beat up the better and nobody should deny him this , not even the selfish roman victims themselves : *in   asterix in britain   , he dismisses the claim that the romans have invaded britain ; he believes that the britons dragged the romans over there in order to have all the fun for themselves . during a rugby match , obelix is bored until he sees how violent the game can get , and is overjoyed , recommending that they play rugby in gaul . *in   asterix in corsica   , it is revealed that the villagers attack the romans at least once a year in order to celebrate the gaulish victory at gergovia . when the romans leave their camps in order to avoid the attacks , obelix sees this behaviour as crazy and detrimental to their friendly relationship . *in   asterix and obelix all at sea   , he has a dream . *the roman civil war between caesar and pompey features in both   asterix the legionary   and   asterix and the actress   . when he witnesses a battle between roman troops , obelix murmurs what a waste ! . but this is not so much on the wasted lives as the fact that it means that he has fewer romans to bash himself .  portrayal  grard depardieu portrays obelix in all four live-action french films based on various comics . the late jacques morel and jacques frantz voiced him in 1967-1968 and 2006           french versions of cartoons . bernard bresslaw , howard lew lewis , brad garrett and rosey grier voiced him in english dubs of cartoons .  name  obelix s name is a pun on the french word   oblisque   , suggested by rotund physique and his habit of casually carrying heavy stone monuments around with him . in fact obelisk is also a variant of the word obelus , a typographical mark often found in a companion role to that of the asterisk , after which his friend asterix is named .
medlineplus = 001553 psychosis refers to an abnormal condition of the mind , and is a generic psychiatric term for a mental state often described as involving a loss of contact with reality . people suffering from psychosis are described as   psychotic .   psychosis is a diagnosis of exclusion . that is , a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded . medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries , diseases and injuries of other organs , psychoactive substances , toxins , and prescribed medications as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed . in medical training , psychosis as a sign of illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent . the           relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and catatonic expressions of schizophrenia and bipolar type 1 disorder . in properly diagnosed psychiatric disorders , psychosis is a descriptive term for the hallucinations , delusions , sometimes violence , and impaired insight that may occur . psychosis is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs . an excess in dopaminergic signalling is hypothesized to be linked to the symptompositive and negative symptoms many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system ; however , meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs show either no significant difference in effects between drug and placebo , or a moderate effect size , suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system . people experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder . depending on its severity , this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior , as           out daily life activities .  signs and symptoms  people with psychosis may have one or more of the following : hallucinations , delusions , catatonia , or a thought disorder , as described below . impairments in social cognition also occur .  hallucinations  a hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli . hallucinations are different from illusions , or perceptual distortions , which are the misperception of external stimuli . hallucinations may occur in any of the five senses and take on almost any form , which may include simple sensations to experiences such as seeing and interacting with fully formed animals and people , hearing voices , and having complex tactile sensations . auditory hallucinations , particularly experiences of hearing voices , are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis . hallucinated voices may talk about , or to , the person , and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities . auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory , commanding or preoccupying           always be a negative one . one research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help . the hearing voices movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers , regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental illness or not .  delusions  psychosis may involve delusional beliefs , some of which are paranoid in nature . put simply , delusions are false beliefs that a person holds on to , without adequate evidence . it can be difficult to change the belief , even with evidence to the contrary . common themes of delusions are persecutory , grandiose , etc . depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood . karl jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into   primary   and   secondary   types . primary delusions are           of normal mental processes , whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person s background or current situation .  catatonia  catatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired . there are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior . the classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake . this type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility . waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person s body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional . the other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above . it involves excessive and purposeless motor behavior , as well as extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality . an example is someone walking           with a level of mental preoccupation that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset . in both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them . it is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania , although someone could have both .  thought disorders  thought disorder describes an underlying disturbance to conscious thought and is classified largely by its effects on speech and writing . affected persons show loosening of associations , that is , a disconnection and disorganization of the semantic content of speech and writing . in the severe form speech becomes incomprehensible and it is known as word salad .  psychiatric disorder  from a diagnostic standpoint , organic disorders were those believed caused by physical illness affecting the brain , while functional disorders were considered disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders .           disorders arise from physical processes ; in this view , the distinction between brain and mind , and therefore between organic and functional disease , is an artificial one . subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional , such as schizophrenia . the dsm-iv-tr avoids the functional/organic distinction , and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses , psychosis due to general medical conditions , and substance-induced psychosis . primary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following : * schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder * affective disorders , including severe depression , and severe depression or mania in bipolar disorder . people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of depression may experience persecutory or self-blaming delusions or hallucinations , while people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of mania may form grandiose delusions . * schizoaffective disorder , involving symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders * brief psychotic disorder , or acute/transient psychotic disorder * delusional disorder * chronic hallucinatory psychosis psychotic symptoms may also be seen in * schizotypal disorder * certain personality disorders           schizoid personality disorder , and borderline personality disorder ) * major depressive disorder in its severe form although it is possible and more likely to have severe depression without psychosis * bipolar disorder in severe mania and/or severe depression although it is possible to have severe mania and/or severe depression without psychosis as well , in fact that is more commonly the case * post-traumatic stress disorder * induced delusional disorder * sometimes in obsessive-compulsive disorder * dissociative disorders , due to many overlapping symptoms , careful differential diagnosis includes especially dissociative identity disorder . stress is known to contribute to and trigger psychotic states . a history of psychologically traumatic events , and the recent experience of a stressful event , can both contribute to the development of psychosis . short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis , and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks . in some rare cases , individuals may remain in a state of full-blown psychosis for many years , or perhaps have attenuated psychotic symptoms present at most times .            without any psychiatric disease . causes or triggers include * falling asleep and waking : hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations , which are entirely normal * bereavement , in which hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common * severe sleep deprivation * sensory deprivation and sensory impairment * caffeine intoxication * extremely stressful event  subtypes  subtypes of psychosis include : * menstrual psychosis , including circa-mensual periodicity , in rhythm with the menstrual cycle . * postpartum psychosis , occurring recently after childbirth * monothematic delusions * myxedematous psychosis * occupational psychosis * stimulant psychosis * tardive psychosis * shared psychosis * cycloid psychosis  cycloid psychosis  cycloid psychosis is psychosis that progresses from normal to full-blown usually within a few hours , not related to drug intake or brain injury . in addition , diagnostic criteria include at least four of the following symptoms : * confusion * mood-incongruent delusions * hallucinations * pan-anxiety , a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances * happiness or ecstasy of high degree * motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type * concern with           than what is needed for diagnosis of an affective disorder cycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 1550 years of age .  causes  many causes of schizophrenia are also causes of psychosis.  medical conditions  a very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis , sometimes called   secondary psychosis   . examples include : * disorders causing   delirium   , in which consciousness is disturbed * neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities , including velocardiofacial syndrome * neurodegenerative disorders , such as alzheimer s disease , dementia with lewy bodies , and parkinson s disease * focal neurological disease , such as stroke , brain tumors , multiple sclerosis , and some forms of epilepsy * malignancy * infectious and postinfectious syndromes , including infections causing delirium , viral encephalitis , hiv , malaria , lyme disease , syphilis * endocrine disease , such as hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , adrenal failure , cushing s syndrome ,           and sometimes childbirth can provoke psychosis , termed puerperal psychosis * inborn errors of metabolism , such as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency , porphyria and metachromatic leukodystrophy * nutritional deficiency , such as vitamin b 12 deficiency * other acquired metabolic disorders , including electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia , hypernatremia , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , hypermagnesemia , hypercalcemia , and hypophosphatemia , but also hypoglycemia , hypoxia , and failure of the liver or kidneys * autoimmune and related disorders , such as systemic lupus erythematosus , sarcoidosis , hashimoto s encephalopathy , and anti-nmda-receptor encephalitis * poisoning , by therapeutic drugs , recreational drugs , and a range of plants , fungi , metals , organic compounds , and a few animal toxins * some sleep disorders , including hallucinations in narcolepsy psychosis can even be caused by familiar ailments such as flu or mumps.  psychoactive drugs  various psychoactive substances have been implicated in causing           users . this may be upon intoxication , for a more prolonged period after use , or upon withdrawal . individuals who have a substance induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness . drugs that can induce psychotic symptoms include cannabis , cocaine , amphetamines , cathinones , psychedelic drugs , -opioid receptor agonists and nmda receptor antagonists .  alcohol  approximately three percent of people who are suffering from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal . alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism . the mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes , gene expression , as well as thiamin deficiency . it is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder , i.e. schizophrenia           risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments .  cannabis  according to some studies , the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness , with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia . while cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by some , it remains controversial , with pre-existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis . some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis , tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol , have opposite effects with respect to psychosis . while thc can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals , cbd may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis . cannabis use has increased dramatically over the past few decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased . together , these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis . high-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the           concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals , and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged .  methamphetamine  methamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26-46 percent of heavy users . some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months . those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine . individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine.  medication  administration , or sometimes withdrawal , of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms . drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally and/or in a significant proportion of patients include amphetamine and other sympathomimetics , dopamine agonists , ketamine , corticosteroids . the purpose of the brain is to collect information from the body , and from the outside world , interpret it to a coherent world view , and produce a meaningful response . the information from the senses enter the brain in the primary sensory areas . they process           the information is interpreted . spontaneous activity in the primary sensory areas may produce hallucinations , which the secondary areas misinterpret as information from the real world . for example , a pet or fmri scan of a person who claims he hears voices may show activation in the primary auditory cortex , or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech . tertiary brain cortex collects the interpretations from the secondary cortexes and creates a coherent world view of it . a study investigating structural changes in the brains of people with psychosis showed there was significant grey matter reduction in the right medial temporal , lateral temporal , and inferior frontal gyrus , and in the cingulate cortex bilaterally of people before and after they became psychotic . findings such as these have led to debate about whether psychosis itself causes excitotoxic brain damage and whether potentially damaging changes to the brain are related to the length of psychotic episode . recent research has suggested that this is not the case although further investigation is still ongoing . studies with sensory deprivation have shown that           to function properly . if the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses , loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours . a similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly , when poor eyesight , hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment . on the other hand , loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses . the 5-ht2a receptor seems to be important for this , since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations . however , the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations , but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli . close relatives to psychotic patients may hear voices , but since they are aware that they are unreal they can ignore them , so that the hallucinations do not affect their reality perception . hence they are not considered psychotic . psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine . in particular , the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and           in the brain , particularly in the mesolimbic pathway . the two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor d2 blocking drugs tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms , and that drugs that boost dopamine activity can trigger psychosis in some people . however , increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate , in particular , with the activity of the nmda receptor . this theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative nmda receptor antagonists such as ketamine , pcp and dextromethorphan induce a psychotic state more readily than dopaminergic stimulants , even at normal recreational doses . the symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia , including negative psychotic symptoms , more closely than amphetamine psychosis . dissociative induced psychosis happens on a more reliable and predictable basis than amphetamine psychosis , which usually only occurs in cases of overdose , prolonged use or           new antipsychotic drugs that act on glutamate and its receptors are currently undergoing clinical trials . the connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed complex . while dopamine receptor d2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity , the d1 receptor increases it . if d2-blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills over to the d1 receptors . the increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell , which takes time . hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis . moreover , newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-ht2a receptors , suggesting the  dopamine hypothesis  may be oversimplified . soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and zoldan et al . reported moderately successful use of ondansetron , a 5-ht 3 receptor antagonist , in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in parkinson s disease patients . psychiatrist david healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy           are known important influences in the aetiology of psychosis . some theories believe many psychotic symptoms are a problem with the perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences . for example , the hallucination of hearing voices may arise from internally generated speech that is mislabeled by the psychotic person as coming from an external source . it has been suggested that persons with bipolar disorder may have increased activity of the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere of the brain , while persons with schizophrenia have increased activity in the right hemisphere . increased level of right hemisphere activation has also been found in people who have high levels of paranormal beliefs and in people who report mystical experiences . it also seems that people who are more creative are also more likely to show a similar pattern of brain activation . some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal , mystical or creative experiences are in any way   by themselves   a symptom of mental illness , as it is still not clear what makes            in otherwise normal individuals , exogenous ligands can produce psychotic symptoms . nmda receptor antagonists , such as ketamine , can produce a similar psychosis to that experienced in schizophrenia . prolonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning , making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder . nmda antagonists replicate some of the so-called negative symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses , and catatonia in high doses . psychostimulants , especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking , can cause some positive symptoms , such as delusional beliefs , particularly those persecutory in nature .  diagnosis  psychosis is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion . so a new-onset episode of psychosis   can not   be considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded , or ruled out . many clinicians improperly perform , or entirely miss this step , introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis . an initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a           assistant . biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use , medication , toxins , surgical complications , or other medical illnesses . delirium should be ruled out , which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations , acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness , indicating other underlying factors , including medical illnesses . excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure : * thyroid-stimulating hormone to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism , * basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance , * full blood count including esr to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease , and * serology to exclude syphilis or hiv infection . other investigations include : * eeg to exclude epilepsy , and an * mri or ct scan of the head to exclude brain lesions . because psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications , such as antidepressants , adhd stimulant medications , and sleep medications , medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out , particularly for first-episode psychosis . both substance- and medication-induced           , using a * urinalysis and a * full serum toxicology screening . because some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania , but can not be ruled out with laboratory tests , a psychotic individual s family , partner , or friends should be asked whether the patient is currently taking any dietary supplements . common mistakes made when diagnosing people who are psychotic include : * not properly excluding delirium , * not appreciating medical abnormalities , * not obtaining a medical history and family history , * indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework , * missing a toxic psychosis by not screening for substances   and   medications * not asking family or others about dietary supplements , * premature diagnostic closure , and * not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder . only after relevant and known causes of psychosis are excluded , a mental health clinician may make a psychiatric differential diagnosis using a person s family history , incorporating information from the person with psychosis , and information from family ,           psychiatric disorders may be established by formal rating scales . the brief psychiatric rating scale assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility , suspicion , hallucination , and grandiosity . it is based on the clinician s interview with the patient and observations of the patient s behavior over the previous 23 days . the patient s family can also answer questions on the behavior report . during the initial assessment and the follow-up , both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item positive and negative symptom scale .  prevention  the evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive . whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short term outcomes , little benefit was seen from these measures after five years . however there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of becoming psychotic in those at high risk , and in 2014 the uk national institute for health and care excellence recommended preventive cbt           treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis . the first line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication , and sometimes hospitalization is needed . however , there are significant problems associated with this class of drugs . there is evidence that they can cause brain damage including prefrontal cortex atrophy , long-lasting parkinsonian symptoms , and personality change . nancy andreasen has argued for an association between antipsychotic drugs and smaller grey matter volumes independent of illness severity . furthermore , antipsychotic drugs can themselves induce psychotic symptoms if they are administered for a long time and then discontinued . there is growing evidence that cognitive behavior therapy , acceptance and commitment therapy and family therapy can be effective in managing psychotic symptoms . when other treatments for psychosis are ineffective , electroconvulsive therapy or ect is sometimes applied to relieve the underlying symptoms of psychosis due to depression . there is also increasing research suggesting that animal-assisted therapy can           schizophrenia .  early intervention  early intervention in psychosis is on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve their longer term outcome . this approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period , where intervention is the most effective , and prevents the long term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness .  history  the word   psychosis   was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by karl friedrich canstatt in his work   handbuch der medizinischen klinik   . he used it as a shorthand for  psychic neurosis  . at that time neurosis meant any disease of the nervous system , and canstatt was thus referring to what was considered a psychological manifestation of brain disease . ernst von feuchtersleben is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845 , as an alternative to insanity and mania . the term stems from the greek     , a giving soul or life to            , soul and the suffix   -   , in this case abnormal condition . the word was also used to distinguish a condition considered a disorder of the mind , as opposed to   neurosis   , which was considered a disorder of the nervous system . the psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of madness , and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one or many forms of the new disease . one type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by koch in 1891 to the  psychopathic inferiorities  - later renamed abnormal personalities by schneider . the division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness and dementia praecox was made by emil kraepelin , who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th century psychiatrists , by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms . kraepelin           the whole spectrum of mood disorders , in a far wider sense than it is usually used today . in kraepelin s classification this would include  unipolar  clinical depression , as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as cyclothymia . these are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood , and patients often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication . schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic episodes that appear unrelated to disturbances in mood , and most non-medicated patients show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes . during the 1960s and 1970s , psychosis was of particular interest to counterculture critics of mainstream psychiatric practice , who argued that it may simply be another way of constructing reality and is not necessarily a sign of illness . for example , r. d. laing argued that psychosis is a symbolic way of expressing concerns in situations where such views may be unwelcome or uncomfortable to the recipients . he went on to say that psychosis could be also seen as a transcendental experience with           of the term mystical psychosis to characterize first-person accounts of psychotic experiences that are similar to reports of mystical experiences . thomas szasz focused on the social implications of labeling people as psychotics , a label he argues unjustly medicalises different views of reality so such unorthodox people can be controlled by society . psychoanalysis has a detailed account of psychosis that differs markedly from that of psychiatry . freud and lacan outlined their perspective on the structure of psychosis in a number of works . since the 1970s , the introduction of a recovery approach to mental health , which has been driven mainly by people who have experienced psychosis , has led to a greater awareness that mental illness is not a lifelong disability , and that there is an expectation that recovery is possible , and probable with effective support .  treatment  early civilizations considered madness a supernaturally inflicted phenomenon . archaeologists have unearthed skulls with clearly visible drillings , some datable back to 5000 bc suggesting that trepanning was a common treatment for psychosis           resultant treatments can be traced back to the new testament . mark 5:8-13 describes a man displaying what would today be described as psychotic symptoms . christ cured this demonic madness by casting out the demons and hurling them into a herd of swine . exorcism , is still utilized in some religious circles as a treatment for psychosis presumed to be demonic possession . a research study of out-patients in psychiatric clinics found that 30 per cent of religious patients attributed the cause of their psychotic symptoms to evil spirits . many of these patients underwent exorcistic healing rituals that , though largely regarded as positive experiences by the patients , had no effect on symptomology . results did , however , show a significant worsening of psychotic symptoms associated with exclusion of medical treatment for coercive forms of exorcism . the medical teachings of the fourth-century philosopher and physician , hippocrates of cos , proposed a natural , rather than supernatural , cause of human illness . in hippocrates  work , the hippocratic corpus , a holistic explanation for health and disease was developed to include madness and           espoused a theory of humoralism wherein disease is resultant of a shifting balance in bodily fluids including blood , phlegm , black bile , and yellow bile . according to humoralism , each fluid or humour has temperamental or behavioral correlates . in the case of psychosis , symptoms are thought to be caused by an excess of both blood and yellow bile . thus , the proposed surgical intervention for psychotic or manic behavior was bloodletting. 18th century physician , educator , and widely considered founder of american psychiatry , benjamin rush , also prescribed bloodletting as a first-line treatment for psychosis . although not a proponent of humoralism , rush believed that active purging and bloodletting were efficacious corrections for disruptions in the circulatory system , a complication he believed was the primary cause of insanity . although rush s treatment modalities are now considered antiquated and brutish , his contributions to psychiatry , namely the biological underpinnings of psychiatric phenomenon including psychosis , have been invaluable to the field . in honor of such contributions , benjamin rush s image is in the official seal of the american           persisting psychosis were characterized by an emphasis on shocking the nervous system . such therapies include insulin shock therapy , cardiazol shock therapy , and electroconvulsive therapy . despite considerable risk , shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia . the acceptance of high-risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery . in 1888 , swiss psychiatrist , gottlieb burckhardt , performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised . although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued , one patient died and several developed aphasia and/or seizure disorders . burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper . this procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored . in the late 1930s , egas moniz conceived the leucotomy in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed . monizs primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists , john fulton and carlyles 1935 experiment in which two           was compared . prior to the leucotomy , the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting . after the procedure , both chimps were pacified and less violent . during the q&amp;a , moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects , a question that fulton admitted was quite startling . moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans suffering from various psychotic disorders , an endeavor for which he received a nobel prize in 1949 . between the late 1930s and early 1970s , the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice , often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes . psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s . the first clinical trial of antipsychotics for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952 . chlorpromazine passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis . although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963           dopamine antagonist , or first generation antipsychotic . while clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features , the side-effects were particularly harsh , which included high rates of often irreversible parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia . with the advent of atypical antipsychotics came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different , though still extensive , side-effect profile that included a lower risk of parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease . atypical antipsychotics remain the first-line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depressive disorder , anxiety disorders , dementia , and some autism spectrum disorders . it is now known that dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter implicated in psychotic symptomology . thus , blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined pharmacologic goal of antipsychotics . recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic           involved in the development of delusional thinking ; that is , connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas . the author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation :
birthplace = zolochiv , poland religion = roald hoffmann is an american theoretical chemist who won the 1981 nobel prize in chemistry . he is the frank h. t. rhodes professor of humane letters , emeritus , at cornell university , in ithaca , new york .  early life   escape from the holocaust  hoffmann was born in zolochiv , poland , to a jewish family , and was named in honor of the norwegian explorer roald amundsen . his parents were clara , a teacher , and hillel safran , a civil engineer . after germany invaded poland and occupied the town , his family was placed in a labor camp where his father , who was familiar with much of the local infrastructure , was a valued prisoner . as the situation grew more dangerous , with prisoners being transferred to liquidation camps , the family bribed guards to allow an escape and arranged with ukrainian neighbors for hoffman , his mother           attic and a storeroom of the local schoolhouse , where they remained for fifteen months , while hoffman was aged 5 to 7 . his father remained at the labor camp , but was able to occasionally visit , until he was tortured and killed by the germans for his involvement in a plot to arm the camp prisoners . when she received the news , his mother attempted to contain her sorrow by writing down her feelings in a notebook her husband had been using to take notes on a relativity textbook he had been reading . while in hiding his mother kept hoffman entertained by teaching him to read and having him memorize geography from textbooks stored in the attic , then quizzing him on it . he referred to the experience as having been enveloped in a cocoon of love . most of the rest of the family perished in the holocaust , though one grandmother and a few others survived . they migrated to the united states in 1949 . hoffman visited zolochiv with his adult son in           was still intact , but the storeroom had been incorporated , ironically enough , into a chemistry classroom . in 2009 , a monument to holocaust victims was built in zolochiv on hoffmann s initiative .  academic credentials  hoffmann graduated in 1955 from new york city s stuyvesant high school , where he won a westinghouse science scholarship . he received his bachelor of arts degree at columbia university in 1958 . he earned his master of arts degree in 1960 from harvard university . he earned his doctor of philosophy degree from harvard university while working under direction of subsequent 1976 nobel prize in chemistry winner william n. lipscomb , jr . under lipscomb s direction the extended hckel method was developed by lawrence lohr and by roald hoffmann . this method was later extended by hoffmann . he went to cornell in 1965 and has remained there , becoming professor emeritus .  chemistry interests  hoffmann has investigated both organic and inorganic substances , developing computational tools and methods such as the extended hckel method , which he proposed in 1963 .           for elucidating reaction mechanisms . he also introduced the isolobal principle .    the world of chemistry   with roald hoffmann  hoffmann is the co-host of the annenberg/cpb educational series ,   the world of chemistry   , with don showalter.  artistic interests  hoffmann is also a writer of poetry published in two collections ,   the metamict state   and   gaps and verges   , and of books explaining chemistry to the general public . also , he co-authored with carl djerassi the play   oxygen   , about the discovery of oxygen , but also about what it means to be a scientist and the importance of process of discovery in science . hoffmann stars in   the world of chemistry   video series with don showalter . since the spring of 2001 , hoffmann has been the host of the monthly series   entertaining science   at new york city s cornelia           and science . hoffmann and brian alan produced an english cover of wei wei s song dedication of love , part of an international music project raising funds to help the victims of the sichuan earthquake .  awards   nobel prize in chemistry  in 1981 , hoffmann received the nobel prize in chemistry , which he shared with kenichi fukui for their theories , developed independently , concerning the course of chemical reactions .  other awards  *priestley medal *arthur c. cope award in organic chemistry *organic chemistry award ,

the pogues are a celtic punk band from london , formed in 1982 and fronted by shane macgowan . the band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s . macgowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with joe strummer and then with spider stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996 . the band reformed in late 2001 , and has been playing regularly ever since , most notably on the us east coast around st patrick s day and across the uk and ireland every december . the group has yet to record any new music and , according to spider stacy on pogues.com , has no inclination to do so . their politically tinged music was informed by macgowan and stacy s punk backgrounds , yet used traditional irish instruments such as the tin whistle , cittern , mandolin and accordion . the pogues were founded in kings cross , a district of central london , in 1982 as pogue mahone   pogue mahone   being the anglicisation of the irish   pg            band history  the future members of the pogues first met when macgowan , peter spider stacy , and jem finer were together in an occasional band called the millwall chainsaws in the late 1970s after macgowan and stacy met in the toilets at a ramones gig at the roundhouse in 1977 . macgowan was already with the nips , though when they broke up in 1980 he concentrated a bit more on stacy s millwall chainsaws , who changed their name to the new republicans . during this period macgowan and finer auditioned unsuccessfully for a licence to busk at covent garden . in 1982 james fearnley , who had been a guitarist with the nips , joined macgowan , stacy , and finer , forming the band , then known as pogue mahone . the new group played their first gig at the pindar of wakefield on 4 october 1982 . they then appeared at gossips in dean street soho on thursday 3 november with trash trash trash and the stingrays . they later added           ) . the band played london pubs and clubs , and released a single , dark streets of london , on their own , self-named label , gaining a small reputationespecially for their live performances . they came to the attention of the media and stiff records when they opened for the clash on their 1984 tour . shortening their name to the pogues they released their first album   red roses for me   on stiff records that october . the band gained more attention when the uk channel 4 s influential music show   the tube   made a video of their version of waxie s dargle for the show . the performance , featuring spider stacy repeatedly smashing himself over the head with a beer tray , became a favourite with the viewers , but stiff records refused to release it as a single , feeling it was too late for it to help   red roses for me   . nevertheless , it remained a favourite request           of punk and new wave forefather elvis costello they recorded the follow-up ,   rum sodomy &amp; the lash   , in 1985 during which time guitarist philip chevron joined . the album title is a famous comment falsely attributed to winston churchill who was supposedly describing the true traditions of the british royal navy . 2005 , and 2006 in polls by music channel vh1 uk , despite not achieving christmas number one when it was released . it was also voted as the 27th greatest song never to reach uk1 in another vh1 poll , and also voted as the 84th greatest song of all time by bbc radio 2 listeners in the sold on song top 100 poll . in 2007 the record was briefly censored by the bbc because of the word faggot being deemed potentially offensive to gay people . following protests from listeners , including the mother of kirsty maccoll , the censorship was lifted . the band was at the peak of its commercial success , with both albums making the top 5 in the uk studio album ,   pogue mahone   . the album was a commercial failure , and , following jem finer s decision to leave the           time to call it quits . according to shane macgowan , amongst the reasons of the break-up was disagreement concerning the political orientation of his songs , the band not wanting to sing too obvious pro-republican songs though some of their previous songs were already politically engaged : for instance ,   streams of whiskey   is about the poet and ira member brendan behan . soon after the break-up shane macgowan recorded a song called   paddy public enemy number one   as a tribute to the republican leader dominic mcglinchey , a former leader of the inla killed a few years before .  post-breakup  after the pogues  break-up , the three remaining long-term members played together briefly as the vendettas . they played mainly new stacy-penned tracks , though darryl hunt also contributed songs , and the band s live set included a few pogues songs . first ranken then hunt left the band , the latter going on to become singer/songwriter in an indie band called bish , whose self-titled debut           to play with a number of other bands , including hkippers , the municipal waterboard and , most recently , the mysterious wheels . in addition to the vendettas who stacy freely admits lost all attraction when the pogues reformed , spider continued to write and record music with various bands , including the james walbourne , filthy thieving bastards , dropkick murphys and astral social club . shane macgowan founded shane macgowan and the popes in 1992 . they only managed two studio albums but struggled on until 2002 . his autobiography   a drink with shane macgowan   , co-written with his journalist girlfriend victoria mary clarke , was released in 2001 . jem finer went into experimental music , playing a big part in a project known as longplayer , a piece of music designed to play continuously for 1,000 years without repeating itself . in 2005 , finer released the album   bum steer   with db bob . james fearnley moved to the united states shortly before leaving the pogues . he was a           cranky george trio . philip chevron reformed his former band the radiators , which briefly included former pogue cait oriordan . terry woods formed the bucks with ron kavana , releasing the album   dancin  to the ceili band   in 1994 . later , he formed the woods band , releasing the album   music from the four corners of hell   in 2002.  reunion  the band , including macgowan , re-formed for a christmas tour in 2001 and performed nine shows in the uk and ireland in december 2004 . in 2002   q   magazine named the pogues as one of the 50 bands to see before you die . in july 2005 , the bandagain including macgowanplayed at the annual guilfest festival in guildford before flying out to japan where they played three dates . japan is the last place they all played together before macgowan was originally sacked in 1991 , and they have a strong following there . they played a date in spain in early september . the reunited pogues played dates in the uk           and re-released their 1987 christmas classic fairytale of new york on 19 december , which went straight in at no. 3 in the uk singles charts on christmas day 2005 , showing the song s enduring popularity . on 22 december 2005 the bbc broadcast a live performance on the jonathan ross christmas show with katie melua filling in for the late kirsty maccoll , the first time the band had played the song live on television . the following week they performed live on the popular music show   cd:uk   . shane macgowan wrote a blog for   the guardian   website in 2006 , detailing his thoughts on the current tour . the band was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the annual meteor ireland music awards in february 2006 . in march 2006 , the band played their first us dates with shane in over 15 years . the band played a series of sold-out concerts in washington , d.c. , atlantic city , boston , and new york . later they played a series of highly           , las vegas , and los angeles , and toured glasgow , manchester , birmingham , london , dublin , and nottingham in mid-december 2006 . they began a second us tour in march 2007 , once again to coincide with a roseland ballroom new york city show on saint patrick s day . 2007 has proved to be the most prolific year of touring since the reunion . a tour of the west coast of america and eleven dates in the uk in december complement the headlining festival appearances made in the summer across europe . they continue to be in huge demand , often selling out very large venues , despite criticism of selling out , and claims that arenas and festivals do not suit the band s sound . guitarist phil chevron has stated there were no plans to record new music or release a new album . chevron said that one way to keep enjoying what they were doing was to avoid making a new album , although he did say that there still is a           not in the near future . terry woods has commented that macgowan has been writing , and most of it sounds good . in 2008 the band released a box set   just look them straight in the eye and say .... pogue mahone ! !   , which included rare studio out-takes and previously unreleased material . the band has received mixed reviews of some recent performances though they continue to pull the crowds . reviewing a march 2008 concert , the   washington post   described macgowan as puffy and paunchy , but said the singer still has a banshee wail to beat howard dean s , and the singer s abrasive growl is all a band this marvelous needs to give its amphetamine-spiked take on irish folk a focal point . the reviewer continued : the set started off shaky , macgowan singing of goin  where streams of whiskey are flowin ,  and looking like he d arrived there already . he grew more lucid and powerful as the evening gathered steam , through two hours and 26 songs , mostly from           . in december 2010 the pogues played what was billed as a farewell uk christmas tour . in march 2011 , the pogues played a six-city/ten-show sold out us tour titled a parting glass with the pogues visiting chicago , detroit , baltimore , washington , d.c. , boston , and new york city , with only the last three cities getting more than one show . it may , or may not , be the last time they tour the states . stacy said i think we are basically pretty certain this is the last tour of this type we ll be doing in the states . there might be the odd sort of one-off here and there . we re not saying this is absolutely , definitely the end . in august 2012 , the pogues embarked on a 30th anniversary summer 2012 8-city european tour scheduled from 4 august 2012 at the stockton weekender festival in stockton-on-tees , uk to 11 &amp; 12 september 2012 at lolympia , paris , two shows filmed and recorded for a           in march 2013 the pogues released   30:30 : the essential collection   , a 2-disc set featuring 30 songs along with eleven videos . in october 2013 , the pogues released a box set titled   pogues 30   containing remastered versions of all of their studio albums plus a previously unreleased live album featuring joe strummer at the london forum in december 1991 . guitarist philip chevron died on 8 october 2013 in dublin , ireland from oesophageal cancer at age 56.  members  ; current members * spider stacy vocals , tin whistle * jem finer banjo , mandola ,

the beyonder is a fictional character in .  publication history  created by jim shooter and mike zeck , the beyonder first appeared in   secret wars   1 as an unseen force . he reappears in   secret wars ii   1 , which was written by jim shooter and drawn by al milgrom.  fictional character biography   secret wars  the beyonder is the sum total of a parallel reality called the beyond-realm or simply beyond , hence the name beyonder . this dimension is accidentally accessed by nebbishy lab technician owen reece . part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues reece with near-infinite powers , which he wields as the villainous molecule man - potentially one of the most powerful villains in the marvel universe . the remaining energy of the pocket dimension apparently gains sentience and curiosity . using its vast powers , the beyonder creates a planet called battleworld out of pieces of various planets           so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil that rages within humanity at large . initially explaining the nature of the experiment to the involuntary participants , the entity identifies itself only as i am from beyond . the name beyonder is quickly applied by galactus and adopted by all others present . galactus , sensing that the beyonder could alleviate his perpetual hunger , immediately and aggressively charges into the beyond-realm through a dimensional rift , followed by doctor doom , who seeks power for his own purposes . both are repelled , but the information gathered by doom later enables him to use the body of the sound-based villain klaw as a medium to steal the energies of galactus  worldship and then the power of the beyonder itself . with the beyonder s power , doom constructs a high tower of golden stone as temporary quarters , and then states that he has given up his ambitions for conquest , instead simply being content with freeing his mother s soul from mephisto . the beyonder s consciousness then possesses klaw s damaged mind and           , distracting him enough for the beyonder to steal his power back . this story formed the basis of the first   secret wars   twelve-issue limited series . the series sold incredibly well , with circulation reaching up to 750,000 copies per issue , numbers reminiscent of the height of comic book sales during the golden age of comic books  secret wars ii  due to the high sales of the first series , a second   secret wars   series , the nine-issue   secret wars ii   miniseries , was published . this series crossed over into almost every comic that marvel was publishing at the time . intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first secret wars , the beyonder comes to earth to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand . he creates a human body for himself ; originally , this body resembles molecule man . he also transforms a television writer named steward cadwell into thundersword . finally , the beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of captain           lack of understanding of human biology and society , which leads to numerous difficult situations , some serious and some humorous . for instance , he needs to learn by example the difference between edible objects and non-edible ones , and needs to be toilet-trained by spider-man . when he learns about the monetary system from luke cage , the hero for hire , he transforms the manhattan heroes for hire office building into gold as thanks for their assistance . he later comes under the influence of a criminal named vinnie and becomes the head of a criminal cartel . the beyonder then uses mind control to assume control over the entire earth , only to relinquish control when he grows restless and frustrated with the lack of free will that the world now displays . beyonder then transforms the elf algrim into kurse . the beyonder became enamored with the beauty and power potential within singing superheroine dazzler , resulting in a brief love affair . on a train to new york , the beyonder meets the mutant tabitha smith . thinking           the beyonder abandons her but returns and takes her to xavier s school . at the school , tabitha is terrified when the teams of the x-men and the new mutants fight the beyonder . the beyonder takes her to a planet where the celestials are located . there , threatening to destroy the universe , the beyonder fights and seemingly defeats a number of celestials . fearful of a further battle taking place between the beyonder and the celestials , tabitha demands to be returned to earth . back on earth , boom boom alerts the avengers about the beyonder . summoning the beyonder , boom boom thereby leads him into an ambush by the avengers , fantastic four , and other costumed champions . the beyonder , who had regarded boom boom as his only friend , allows the avengers to defeat him , but then leaves . boom boom leaves during the battle . the beyonder then acts in an attempt to preserve life throughout the universe by seemingly eliminating and then resurrecting the manifestation of death . throughout the course of the series , the demon mephisto           win the favor of death . mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the legion accursed to attack the beyonder , who is saved by the thing . the beyonder then fights the puma , believing that the only purpose left in his life is to help the puma find his by allowing puma to become one with the universe and allow puma to slay him- puma having been convinced of the beyonder s nature as a malicious threat- , but a casual comment by spider-man about the beyonder s manipulations causes puma to lose faith in himself at the crucial moment , and the beyonder survives unscathed . the beyonder then feels the futility of all his efforts and decides to destroy the entire multiverse . he starts by killing the new mutants . he then battles phoenix . the beyonder reconsiders destroying the multiverse , and resurrects the new mutants . realizing that he can never truly understand what its like to be mortal as long as he has his powers as a safety net , he constructs a machine to leech and contain his powers , turning him           becomes fearful of being without his power and takes his power back from the machine . intrigued by this new experience , the beyonder tries to create for himself a mortal human infant body that can retain his omnipotence , but will allow him to grow and learn at a normal rate . although he is on the verge of succeeding , he is killed in the process by the molecule man . the beyonder s near-limitless power is returned to the now-empty beyond-realm , where it forms a big bang and creates a new universe .  deadpool team-up  long after the   secret wars ii   crossover had ended , a deadpool special featured the secret wars ii continues in this issue corner tag that was used during that original storyline . in this issue , a younger , less-experienced deadpool is hired by the kingpin to kill the beyonder . the flashback sequence ends with deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying to be continued in secret wars iii . this storyline has yet to be followed up on .  kosmos           years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the beyonder and the energy that gives the molecule man his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable , mature , nigh-omnipotent being to be born . the beyonder then merges with the molecule man . this being , called kosmos at some unknown point , kosmos goes mad and assumes a mortal form , now calling itself the maker . after the now amnesiac maker destroys a shiar colony , the imperial guard manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the kyln . the maker s madness takes control of several inmates , but is finally subdued by the nihilist thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners . thanos confronts the maker , and , by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture , manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind . thanos instructs the shiar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead , or the beyonder essence would go free again . apparently , thanos had           never been explained , as thanos was dead at the time of secret wars ii . thanos  flashback showed thanos as a youngster .    beyond !   and annihilation  the beyonder returned in the series named after him , beyond ! . this being was called the beyonder in the second issue . this beyonder is once again in command of the patchwork battleworld , where it is revealed that he has been collecting various superhumans and pitting them in combat with one another . eventually , the pool of heroes and villains featured in the mini-series discovers that this beyonder is actually the stranger , who has been conducting studies of super-humanity through re-creations of the original secret war . in the annihilation crossover , the former herald of galactus , the fallen one , now under the control of thanos , is sent to investigate the aftermath of the kyln s destruction by the annihilation wave and ascertain the beyonder s fate . the fallen one soon finds the lifeless form of kosmos in the rubble .  new avengers : the illuminati            3 , featuring a retcon of past events , charles xavier reveals that in the original secret war , he had initially planned to use his powers to make everyone fall asleep and thus buy him and reed richards time to formulate an escape plan , but feared the beyonder s wrath . however , he immediately sensed a strange mental presence and attempted to mind-scan the beyonder , revealing him as one of the inhumans previously ruled over by fellow illuminati member black bolt . xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the beyonder s seemingly godlike abilities , which was that the beyonder was not only an inhuman but also a mutant , like xavier and his own team of x-men , and the exposure of his mutant genes to terrigen mists had created an unprecedented reaction , bestowing upon him more amazing power and knowledge than all other inhumans of his time . this revelation leads to a confrontation with the beyonder during the events of the second secret war , wherein black bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the beyonder s activities . when encountered ,           on ceres the story itself is deliberately ambiguous ; black bolt , for example , does not remember the mutant inhuman who vanished , making it possible the beyonder arranged all this as a mind game , as he had when he lived as a human and a mutant , trying to find a purpose in his existence .  powers and abilities  although not native to this dimension , the beyonder was one of the absolute strongest and most powerful beings ever to exist in the marvel universe . in the original secret wars storyline , he was the be-all and end-all of the marvel universe that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings , and capable of destroying the entire multiverse or the conceptual entity death itself . after his creator , jim shooter , left marvel , writer-editor tom defalco , displeased with shooter s tenure at marvel , re-tooled the beyonder and altered his origin . he was no longer omnipotent as many initially believed , being an incomplete cosmic cube , with less raw power and the           possessed vast psionic abilities allowing him to control and manipulate matter and energy at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities . he was shown and described to repel galactus like a bug , and even greatly exceeded the collected energy of the latter s world-ship . he once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first secret wars , and later , by using his entire energies , created a universe out of his own being . when the molecule man extracted the beyonder from kosmos , their battle took place in more than three dimensions , and threatened vast portions of reality . in kosmos   maker  incarnation , she was stated as capable of reversing the crunch itself , essentially collapsing the entire universe . the beyonder could endow himself with a corporeal form of practically limitless strength and endurance . however , his scale of power has been claimed to be below that of the living tribunal and eternity , the celestials , or the molecule man mister mxyzptlk parodied the beyonder in his first appearance in the post-crisis continuity by assuming a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the beyonder . he called himself ben deroy , an anagram of the name beyonder . when asked by lois lane where he came from , he answers by saying , oh ... here and there . yonder , let s say . yes . yonder . in the   spider-ham   universe , the bee-yonder briefly appears to give spider-ham a version of the black uniform , stating that the familiar red-and-blue uniform was out of style .  in other media  the beyonder makes an appearance in the   spider-man   cartoon voiced by earl boen . however , his appearance in the cartoon greatly differs from his normal comics , featuring the brief super hero costume the beyonder           and a goatee as opposed to having a clean-shaven face with a disco outfit . he is also more of a neutral force than a villain . the beyonder first appeared in the episode arrival of season 5 , the first chapter of that secret wars in the series . the beyonder worked with madame web to prepare spider-man for the secret wars , supposedly to see whether good was more powerful than evil . he put spider-man and a small group of heroes selected by the web-slinger on a planet and pit them against a band of villains . during this time , doctor doom stole the beyonder s powers in doom , but he was defeated , and it was implied that he had planned the whole ordeal out before it began . the beyonder had all the heroes spider-man had summoned to           . spider-man , however , was needed for something bigger , so he was the only one whose memory was untouched . it was revealed that the evil spider-carnage had destroyed the entire multiverse with a giant bomb . however , when the destruction reached the beyonder s own reality , he used all of his powers to roll back time , but since his powers were unlimited only in his own universe he would be unable to permanently undo spider-carnage s actions himself . though it tested him to the extreme , he sent his servant , madame web , into the past to train spider-men from many different realities to find out which one would be worthy enough to lead the others against spider-carnage.
* augustus iii ascends the throne * bourbon territorial gains the war of the polish succession was a major european war for princes  possessions sparked by a polish civil war over the succession to augustus ii , king of poland that other european powers widened in pursuit of their own national interests . france and spain , the two bourbon powers , attempted to check the power of the austrian habsburgs in western europe , as did the kingdom of prussia ; whilst saxony and russia mobilized to support the eventual polish victor . the slight amount of fighting in poland resulted in the accession of augustus iii , who in addition to russia and saxony , was politically supported by the habsburgs . the war s major military campaigns occurred outside poland . the bourbons , supported by charles emmanuel iii of sardinia , moved against isolated habsburg territories . in the rhineland france successfully took the duchy of lorraine , and in italy spain regained control over the kingdoms of naples and sicily in which augustus iii was confirmed as king of poland and his opponent stanisaw leszczyski was awarded the duchy of lorraine . francis stephen , the duke of lorraine , was given the grand duchy of tuscany in compensation for the loss of lorraine . the duchy of parma went to austria whereas charles of parma took the crowns of naples and sicily , resulting in territorial gains for the bourbons . poland also gave up claims to livonia and direct control over the duchy of courland and semigallia , which , although remaining a polish fief , was not integrated into poland proper , and came under strong russian influence .  background  ever since the death of sigismund ii augustus in 1572 , polish kings were elected           great deal of power over the king , but the sejms to elect kings and conduct other business were in later years paralyzed by the institution of the liberum veto , which gave any individual in the sejm the power to negate its decisions . as a result , poland s powerful neighbors were able to exert significant influence on the decision-making process , and by the early 18th century the system was in decline . former polish king stanisaw leszczyski hoped to be elected king once again upon the death of his old adversary , augustus ii of saxony , who had failed in his attempts to make the polish crown hereditary within his family . thirty years earlier , stanisaw had been installed as king of poland by king charles xii of sweden during his period of dominance in the early part of the great northern war , and was ousted following the battle of poltava by the victorious russians . stanisaw was supported in his bid to regain the throne by his son-in-law , king louis xv of france , who hoped to           to balance russian and austrian power in central , northern and eastern europe . in 1732 empress anna of russia , holy roman emperor charles vi and king frederick william i of prussia , irritated with augustus but unwilling to allow stanisaw to become king , secretly signed lwenwolde s treaty , in which they agreed to jointly back the candidacy of infante manuel of portugal for the polish throne . france s prime minister , cardinal fleury , saw the polish struggle as a chance to strike at austrian power in the west without seeming to be the aggressor . while he cared little for who should become king of poland , the cause of protecting the king s father-in-law was a sympathetic one , and he hoped to use the war as a means of humbling the austrians , and perhaps securing the long-desired duchy of lorraine from its duke , francis stephen , who was expected to marry emperor charles s daughter maria theresa , which would bring austrian power dangerously close to the french border . fleury s diplomatic moves would bring additional powers into the war           spain and the charles emmanuel , the king of sardinia who was also the duke of savoy .  death of augustus ii  augustus ii died on february 1 , 1733 . throughout the spring and summer of 1733 , france began building up forces along its northern and eastern frontiers , while the emperor massed troops on polish borders , reducing garrisons in the duchy of milan for the purpose . while the aging prince eugene of savoy had recommended to the emperor a more warlike posture against potential actions by france in the rhine valley and northern italy , only minimal steps were taken to improve imperial defenses on the rhine . the marquis de monti , france s ambassador in warsaw , convinced the rival potocki and czartoryski families to unite behind stanisaw . teodor potocki , primate of poland and interrex following the death of augustus , called a convocation sejm in march 1733 . delegates to this sejm passed a resolution forbidding the candidacy of foreigners ; this would explicitly exclude both emmanuel of portugal and augustus ii s son , frederick august ii ,           austria and russia in july 1733 . in exchange for russian support , he agreed to give up any remaining polish claims to livonia , and promised to anna of russia her choice of successor to the duchy of courland , a polish fief which would have otherwise come under direct polish rule on the death of the current duke , ferdinand kettler , who had no heirs . to the austrian emperor he promised recognition of the pragmatic sanction of 1713 , a document designed to guarantee inheritance of the austrian throne to maria theresa , charles  oldest child . in august , polish nobles gathered for the election sejm . on august 11 , 30,000 russian troops under field marshal peter lascy entered poland in a bid to influence the sejm s decision . on september 4 , france openly declared its support for leszczyski , who was elected king by a sejm of 12,000 delegates on september 12 . a group of nobles , led by lithuanian magnates including duke michael           ii ) , crossed the vistula river to praga and the protection of russian troops . this group , numbering about 3,000 , elected frederick august ii king of poland as augustus iii on october 5 . despite the fact that this group was a minority , russia and austria , intent on maintaining their influence within poland , recognised augustus as king . on october 10 , france declared war on austria and saxony . louis xv was later joined by his uncle , king philip v of spain , who hoped to secure territories in italy for his sons by his second marriage to elizabeth farnese . specifically , he hoped to secure mantua for the elder son , don carlos , who was already duke of parma and had the expectation of the grand duchy of tuscany , and the kingdoms of naples and sicily for the younger son , don felipe . the two bourbon monarchs were also joined by charles emmanuel of savoy , who hoped to secure gains from the austrian duchies of milan and mantua.  austrian isolation  when hostilities finally broke out           powers , great britain and the dutch republic . they were disappointed in this , since both the dutch and the british chose to pursue a policy of neutrality . the british prime minister sir robert walpole justified britain s non-intervention by insisting that the anglo-austrian alliance agreed at the 1731 treaty of vienna was a purely defensive agreement , while austria was in this instance the aggressor . this position was attacked by english austrophiles who wanted to aid the austrians against france , but walpole s dominant position ensured that britain stayed out of the conflict . the french , not wishing to provoke britain , carefully chose not to campaign in the austrian netherlands and avoided campaigning in parts of the holy roman empire that might draw either power into the conflict . on austria s southern border , france in november 1733 negotiated the secret treaty of turin with charles emmanuel and prepared for military operations in northern italy . it concluded the treaty of the escorial with spain , which included promises of french assistance in the spanish conquest of naples and           the ottoman empire in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict in support of stanisaw . the austrians were thus left largely without effective external allies on their southern and western frontiers . their russian and saxon allies were occupied with the polish campaign , and the emperor distrusted frederick william i of prussia , who was willing to provide some aid . divisions within the empire also had an impact on the raising of troops in 1733 , as charles-albert of bavaria , who harbored ambitions to become the next holy roman emperor , signed a secret agreement with france in november 1733 , and tried , with limited success , to dissuade other rulers within the empire from the wittelsbach family from providing troops to the emperor under their treaty obligations . while britain itself did not provide support , the electorate of hanover , where george ii also ruled as an imperial elector , proved willing to help .  war   poland  the russians , led by lascy , quickly took warsaw and installed augustus , forcing stanisaw to flee to danzig was forced to withdraw these forces to the imperial encampment at heilbronn . this cleared the way for the french army under the duke of berwick to besiege the imperial fort at philippsburg , which fell after a siege of two months in july 1734 . eugene , who was accompanied by crown prince frederick of prussia , made some attempts to relieve the siege , but never made any decisive attacks against the besieging army owing to its size and relatively poor quality of the troops under his command . berwick was killed by a shell at philippsburg . french armies continued to advance along           the growing imperial army , which came to include troops from russia that had assisted with the capture of danzig , was able to prevent france from establishing a siege there , and eugene went on the offensive . a force of 30,000 under friedrich heinrich von seckendorff crossed the rhine and began pushing the french back toward trier , defeating them at clausen in october 1735 , in one of the last battles before preliminary peace terms were reached .  italy  french and savoyard troops numbering over 50,000 , under the command of charles emmanuel , entered milanese territory as early as october 24 , against minimal resistance , as the austrian forces in the duchy numbered only about 12,000 . by november 3 , the city of milan itself had surrendered , although the austrian governor , count wirich philipp von daun , still held the fortress . france s great general , the duke de villars , joined charles emmanuel in milan on november 11 . while villars wanted to immediately move to secure the alpine passes against austrian reinforcements by moving against mantua , charles           with spain , sought to secure milan . the army spent the next three months eliminating austrian opposition from the remaining fortified towns in the duchy . villars attempted to interest don carlos of parma in joining the expedition against mantua , but carlos was focused on the campaign into naples . villars began to move against mantua , but charles emmanuel resisted , and the army made little progress . in early may , an austrian army of 40,000 under count claude florimond de mercy crossed the alps and threatened to close in on the french army s rear by a flanking maneuver . villars responded by retreating from mantua and attempted without success to interrupt the austrian army s crossing of the po river . villars , frustrated by charles emmanuel s delaying tactics , quit the army on may 27 . he fell ill on the way back to france and died in turin on june 17 . mercy s forces made repeated attempts to cross the parma river in june , but it was not until late in that month that they were able to cross the           allied forces , now under the command of french marshals de broglie and coigny , were entrenched . in a bloody battle near the village of crocetta on june 29 , the austrians were beaten back , mercy was killed , and frederick of wrttemberg , his second , was wounded . charles emmanuel returned the next day to retake command , and resumed his delaying tactics by failing to immediately pursue the retreating austrians . the austrians retreated to the po , where they were reinforced by additional troops and placed under the command of field marshal knigsegg . after two months of inaction , during which the armies faced each other across the secchia river , knigsegg on september 15 took advantage of lax security and executed a raid on coigny s headquarters at quistello , very nearly capturing coigny and taking among other prizes charles emmanuel s china . two days later the french withdrew to a position near guastalla in response to austrian maneuvers , but one detachment of nearly 3,000 men was surrounded and captured by the advancing austrians . on september 19 , knigsegg attacked           encounter , was beaten back , losing among others frederick of wrttemberg . knigsegg retreated across the po , adopting a defensive position between the po and the oglio while charles emmanuel again did not capitalize on his victory . when he finally withdrew most of the allied army to cremona , the austrians advanced on the north bank of the po as far as the adda before both armies entered winter quarters in december 1734 . in southern italy , the austrians , choosing a strategy of defending a large number of fortresses , were soundly defeated . don carlos assembled an army composed primarily of spaniards , but also including some troops from france and savoy . moving south through the papal states , his army flanked the frontline austrian defense at mignano , forcing them to retreat into the fortress at capua . he was then practically welcomed into naples by the city fathers , as the austrian viceroy had fled toward bari , and the fortresses held by the austrians in the city were quickly captured . while maintaining a blockade of the largest austrian holdings at           army gave chase to the remaining austrian forces . these finally attempted a stand in late may , and were defeated at bitonto . capua and gaeta were then properly besieged while austrian fortresses in sicily were quickly subdued . gaeta surrendered in august , and capua held out until november when its commander , otto ferdinand von abensberg und traun , finally negotiated surrender terms when he ran out of ammunition . the jacobite pretender to the thrones of united kingdom and france , charles edward stuart , who was under 14 then , also participated in the french and spanish siege of gaeta , making his first exposure to battle . the armies in northern italy suffered significantly over the winter , with significant losses to disease and desertion . for the 1735 campaign the allied forces in northern italy came under the command of the duke de noailles , elevated to marshal after his successful contributions to the rhine campaign . they were also joined by spanish forces in may , now available after the successes in the south . in response to this threat , knigsegg retreated           city of mantua well-defended . at this point divisions between the allies became clear , as spain laid claim to mantua , and also refused to guarantee milan to charles emmanuel . in response , charles emmanuel refused to allow his siege equipment to be used against mantua . as a result , the franco-spanish army was unable to do more than blockade the city . when charles emmanuel withdrew his forces from the area , the allies were forced to retreat , and the beleaguered austrians capitalized , eventually recovering most of milan against little opposition in november .  peace settlement  as early as february 1734 the british and dutch had offered to mediate peace talks between the various parties . by early 1735 , proposals were being circulated . as 1735 progressed with the austrians being in no real position to continue the fight , and the french concerned by the possible arrival of russian reinforcements on the rhine , negotiations continued through the summer of 1735 . a preliminary peace was finally concluded in october 1735 and ratified in the           as king of poland , stanisaw was compensated with lorraine , while the former duke of lorraine , francis stephen , was made heir to the grand duchy of tuscany . charles of parma gave up parma , which came under direct austrian rule , but he was richly compensated by being confirmed instead as king of naples and sicily . although fighting stopped after the preliminary peace in 1735 , the final peace settlement had to wait until the death of the last medici grand duke of tuscany , gian gastone in 1737 , to allow the territorial exchanges provided for by the peace settlement to go into effect . the french , hoping for dtente and good relations with the austrians , now also recognized the pragmatic sanction that would allow emperor charles s daughter maria theresa to succeed him . this proved a hollow guarantee , however , as the french decided to intervene to partition the habsburg monarchy after all following the death of charles in           king , however , proved of lasting benefit to france , as it passed under direct french rule with stanisaw s death in 1766 . stanisaw signed the act of abdication in 1736 , while augustus iii pronounced a general amnesty . winiowiecki was rewarded : the king made him the grand hetman of lithuania

depleted uranium is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope u-235 than natural uranium . : depleted uranium possesses only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium , having been  depleted  of much of its most highly radioactive u 234 and u 235 isotopes . . uses of du take advantage of its very high density of 19.1 g/cm 3 . civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft , radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment and containers used to transport radioactive materials . military uses include defensive armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles . most depleted uranium arises as a byproduct of the production of enriched uranium for use in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons . enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration           is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction ) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium , in some cases with mass fractions of u-235 and u-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium . u-238 has a much longer halflife than the lighter isotopes , and du therefore emits less alpha radiation than the same mass of natural uranium : the us defense department states du used in us munitions has 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium . since the u-235 content of nuclear reactor fuel is reduced by fission , uranium recovered by nuclear reprocessing from spent nuclear reactor fuel made from natural uranium will have a lower-than-natural u-235 concentration . such  reactor-depleted  material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct du , and can be distinguished from it by the presence of u-236 . trace transuranics have been reported to be present in some us tank armor . the use of du in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects . normal functioning           and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure , because uranium is a toxic metal . it is only weakly radioactive because of its long radioactive half-life . the biological half-life for uranium is about 15 days . the aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites , leading to possible inhalation by human beings . the actual level of acute and chronic toxicity of du is also a point of medical controversy . several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic , and of genetic , reproductive , and neurological effects from chronic exposure . a 2005 epidemiology review concluded : in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du . the world health organization , the directing and coordinating authority for health within           , developmental , or carcinogenic effects have been reported in humans due to du exposure .  history  enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the united states and britain began their nuclear weapons programs . later in the decade , france and the soviet union began their nuclear weapons and nuclear power programs . it was at this time that depleted uranium was first stored as an unusable waste product . there was some hope that the enrichment process would be improved and fissionable isotopes of u-235 could , at some future date , be extracted from the depleted uranium . this re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 contained in the depleted uranium is no longer a matter of the future : it has been practiced for several years . also , it is possible to design civilian power-generating reactors using unenriched fuel , but only about 10%cite print in the 1970s , the pentagon reported that the soviet military had developed armor plating for warsaw pact tanks that nato ammunition could not penetrate . the pentagon began searching for material to           ordnance researchers settled on depleted uranium . the us and nato militaries used du penetrator rounds in the 1991 gulf war , the bosnia war , while clearing a decades-old hawaii firing range in 2005 , workers found depleted uranium fins from training rounds from the formerly classified davy crockett recoilless gun tactical battlefield nuclear delivery system from the 1960s and 1970s . these training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before du had become an item of interest , more than 20 years before the gulf war .  production and availability  natural uranium metal contains about 0.71% u-235 , 99.28% u-238 , and about 0.0054% u-234 . in order to produce enriched uranium , the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the u-235 for use in nuclear power , weapons , or other uses . the remainder ,   depleted uranium   , contains only 0.2% to 0.4% u-235 . because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of u-235 , enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium . for example           kg of natural uranium , and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% u-235 remaining . the nuclear regulatory commission defines   depleted uranium   as uranium with a percentage of the 235 u isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight . the military specifications designate that the du used by the u.s. department of defense contain less than 0.3% 235 u . in actuality , dod uses only du that contains approximately 0.2% 235 u . depleted uranium is also produced by recycling  spent  nuclear fuel , in which case it contains traces of pu and np and has therefore been called  dirty du  although the quantities are so small that they are considered to be not of serious radiological significance by ecrr.  uranium hexafluoride  some depleted uranium produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride , a crystalline solid , uf 6 , in steel cylinders           each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes of uf 6 . in the u.s. 560,000 tonnes of depleted uf 6 had accumulated by 1993 . in 2008 , 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near portsmouth , ohio and paducah , kentucky . the storage of duf 6 presents environmental , health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . when uf 6 is exposed to water vapor in the air , it reacts with the moisture to produce uo 2 f 2 , a solid , and hf , a gas , both of which are highly soluble and toxic . the uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak , limiting further escape of depleted uf 6 . release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation . storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks , and are repainted and repaired as necessary . a tenfold           u.s. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion , assuming doe re-enriches the tails . this estimate is based on february 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services , and doe s access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity . there have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the united states , including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of uf 6 and its reaction products . 1 person died , and while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term kidney damage , none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium . the u.s. government has been converting duf 6 to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal . such disposal of the entire duf 6 inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million . : : : : : : : : world depleted uranium inventory : : : : : : : : : :  military applications  depleted uranium is very dense ; at 19,050 kg/m , it           less dense than tungsten and gold , and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium , which are the densest known substances under standard pressures . consequently a du projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile , with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact . du projectile ordnance is often inherently incendiary because of its pyrophoric property .  armor plate  because of its high density , depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor , sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate . for instance , some late-production m1a1ha and m1a2 abrams tanks built after 1998 have du reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret , and there is a program to upgrade the rest .  nuclear weapons  depleted uranium is used as a tamper in fission bombs .  ammunition  most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance , primarily the 30           of the a-10 thunderbolt ii used by the united states air force . 25 mm du rounds have been used in the m242 gun mounted on the u.s. army s bradley fighting vehicle and the marine corp s lav-25 . the u.s. marine corps uses du in the 25 mm pgu-20 round fired by the gau-12 equalizer cannon of the av-8b harrier , and also in the 20 mm m197 gun mounted on ah-1 cobra helicopter gunships . the united states navy s phalanx ciws s m61 vulcan gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots made using depleted uranium , later changed to tungsten . another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators , anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the british challenger 1 , challenger 2 , m1a1 and m1a2 abrams . kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long , relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot . staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals , usually titanium or molybdenum . one formulation has a composition of 99.25%           titanium . staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition . the us army uses du in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium . according to 2005 research , at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions , such as tungsten-cobalt or tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys , also possess extreme carcinogenic properties , which by far exceed those of depleted uranium itself : 100% of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks . depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and pyrophoric . on impact with a hard target , such as an armored vehicle , the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp . the impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties . when a du penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire           and possibly causing the vehicle to explode . du is used by the u.s. army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the m1 abrams tank . the russian military has used du ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s , mostly for the 115 mm guns in the t-62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the t-64 , t-72 , t-80 , and t-90 tanks . the du content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles , 200 g in 25 mm ones , 280 g in 30 mm , 3.5 kg in 105 mm , and 4.5 kg in 120 mm penetrators . du was used during the mid-1990s in the u.s. to make hand grenades , cluster bombs , and land mines , but those applications have been discontinued , according to alliant techsystems . the us navy used du in its 20 mm phalanx ciws guns , but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten . it is thought that between 17 and 20 countries have weapons incorporating depleted uranium in their arsenals . they include the           , india , turkey , saudi arabia , israel , bahrain , egypt , kuwait , pakistan , thailand , iraq and taiwan . iran also has performed wide research on du penetrators since 2001 . du ammunition is manufactured in 18 countries . only the us and the uk have acknowledged using du weapons . in a three-week period of conflict in iraq during 2003 it was estimated that over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used .  legal status in weapons  in 1996 the international court of justice gave an advisory opinion on the   legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons   . this made it clear , in paragraphs 54 , 55 and 56 , that international law on poisonous weaponsthe second hague declaration of 29 july 1899 , hague convention iv of 18 october 1907 and the geneva protocol of 17 june 1925did not cover nuclear weapons , because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate . this icj opinion was about nuclear weapons , but the sentence the terms have been           ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime , or even exclusive , effect is to poison or asphyxiate , also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate , but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy . the sub-commission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities of the united nations human rights commission , passed two motions the first in 1996 and the second in 1997 . they listed weapons of mass destruction , or weapons with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and urged all states to curb the production and the spread of such weapons . included in the list was weaponry containing depleted uranium . the committee authorized a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , of the weapons . the requested un working paper was delivered in 2002 by y. k. j. yeung sik yuen in accordance with sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights resolution 2001/36 . he argues that the use of du           the subcommission , may breach one or more of the following treaties : the universal declaration of human rights , the charter of the united nations , the genocide convention , the united nations convention against torture , the geneva conventions including protocol i , the convention on conventional weapons of 1980 , and the chemical weapons convention . yeung sik yuen writes in paragraph 133 under the title   legal compliance of weapons containing du as a new weapon   : louise arbour , chief prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of du in weapons . their findings were that :  requests for a moratorium on military use  some states and the international coalition to ban uranium weapons , a coalition of more than 155 non-governmental organizations , have asked for a ban on the production and military use of depleted uranium weapons . the european parliament has repeatedly passed resolutions requesting an immediate moratorium on the further use of depleted uranium ammunition , but france and britain           united nations security council have consistently rejected calls for a ban , maintaining that its use continues to be legal , and that the health risks are unsubstantiated . in 2007 france , britain , the netherlands , and the czech republic voted against a united nations general assembly resolution to hold a debate in 2009 about the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium . all other european union nations voted in favour or abstained . the ambassador from the netherlands explained his negative vote as being due to the reference in the preamble to the resolution to potential harmful effects of the use of depleted uranium munitions on human health and the environment which can not , in our view , be supported by conclusive scientific studies conducted by relevant international organizations . none of the other permanent members of the united nations security council supported the resolution as china was absent for the vote , russia abstained and the united states voted against the resolution . in september 2008 , and in response to the 2007 general assembly resolution , the un secretary general           international atomic energy agency and world health organization . the iaea and who evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue . the report was largely split between states concerned about depleted uranium s use , such as finland , cuba , japan , serbia , argentina , and predominantly nato members , who do not consider the use of depleted uranium munitions problematic . in december 2008 , 141 states supported a resolution requesting that three un agencies : united nations environment programme , who and iaea update their research on the impact of uranium munitions by late 2010 to coincide with the general assembly s 65th session , four voted against , 34 abstained and 13 were absent as before britain and france voted against the resolution . all other european union nations voted in favour or abstained : the netherlands , which voted against a resolution in 2007 , voted in favour , as did finland and norway , both of which had abstained in 2007 , while the czech republic , which voted against the resolution in           against the resolution were israel and the united states , while as before china was absent for the vote , and russia abstained . on june 21 , 2009 , belgium became the first country in the world to ban : inert ammunition and armour that contains depleted uranium or any other industrially manufactured uranium . the move followed a unanimous parliamentary vote on the issue on 22 march 2007 . the text of the 2007 law allowed for two years to pass until it came into force . in april 2009 , the belgian senate voted unanimously to restrict investments by belgian banks into the manufacturers of depleted uranium weapons . in september 2009 the latin american parliament passed a resolution calling for a regional moratorium on the use , production and procurement of uranium weapons . it also called on the parlatino s members to work towards an international uranium weapons treaty . in april 2011 the congress of costa rica passed a law prohibiting uranium weapons in its territories , becoming the second country in the world to do           bill seeking to outlaw depleted uranium weapons , but it lapsed before approval by the dil  civilian applications  depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material , and as ballast . examples include sailboat keels , as counterweights and as shielding in industrial radiography cameras .  shielding in industrial radiography cameras  industrial radiography cameras include a very high activity gamma radiation source . depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source . typically the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in polyurethane foam for thermal , mechanical and oxidation protection . and zeus detectors ) in due to its high density and natural radioactivity.  health considerations  normal functioning of the kidney , brain , liver , heart , and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because , in addition to being weakly radioactive , uranium is a toxic metal , if du particles do enter an individual , the type of danger           depend on the solubility of the particles . . briefly , inhaled and insoluble means the du particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymph nodes , presenting a radiological risk ; highly soluble means those particles are off to the kidneys , where toxicity is the issue . in military conflicts involving du munitions , the major concern is inhalation of du particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of du-enhanced projectiles with their targets . when depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn , they create depleted uranium oxides in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds . the institute of nuclear technology-radiation protection of attiki , greece , has noted that the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel . the utilisation of du in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment . in early 2004 , the uk pensions appeal tribunal service attributed birth defect claims from a february 1991 gulf           a 2005 epidemiology review concluded : in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du . studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic , genetic , reproductive , and neurological effects from chronic exposure .  chemical toxicity  the chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater   in vitro   than its radiological hazard , with the kidney considered to be the main target organ . . health effects of du are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external . three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur : inhalation , ingestion , and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination . properties such as phase , oxidation state , and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption , distribution , translocation , elimination and the resulting toxicity . for example , metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent           of 2004 review information regarding uranium toxicity ! body system ! human studies ! animal studies !   in vitro   uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided . it will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium and soluble uranium salts . soluble uranium salts are toxic . uranium slowly accumulates in several organs , such as the liver , spleen , and kidneys . the world health organization has established a daily tolerated intake of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5 g/kg body weight , or 35 g for a 70 kg adult . epidemiological studies and toxicological tests on laboratory animals point to it as being immunotoxic , and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometers from target areas , and that such particles , if inhaled , would remain undissolved in the lung for a great length of time and thus could be detected in urine . violently burning uranium droplets produce a gaseous vapor comprising about half of the uranium in their original mass . uranyl ion contamination in uranium oxides has           approximately 90 micrograms of natural uranium , on average , exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water , food and air . most is in the skeleton . the biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium .  radiological hazards  the primary radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to alpha particles , which do not travel far through air , and do not penetrate clothing . however , in a matter of a month or so , a sample of pure depleted uranium will generate small amounts of thorium-234 and protactinium-234 , which emit the more penetrating beta particles at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays . this is because uranium-238 decays directly to thorium-234 , which with a half-life of 24 days decays to protactinium-234 , which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long-lived uranium-234 . a quasi-steady state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days . available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard . surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining             bmj   concluded it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict . while agreeing with the editorial s conclusion , a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed , given that global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran , and that , as of april 2001 , no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested . . mould s suggestion was electron paramagnetic resonance dosimetry using tooth enamel . he also wrote that the us national institute of standards and technology was able , using this method , to measure doses as low as 20 msv , and that , if it were asked to , the nist would be able to get involved , meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans . the author of the reply , a radiation scientist , went on to suggest a method that had been used several times           the widespread use of du in the iraq war , at least a year after the conflict began , testing for uk troops was still only in the discussion phase . , which found that perhaps a quarter of all uk troops would have been interested in undergoing du-related monitoring , although the desire for du screening is more closely linked to current health status rather than plausible exposure to du . confusingly , reports that testing is now available to all troops that served in iraq , and does not say if this is testing la mould . the royal society du working group concluded in 2002 that there were very low health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium , though also ventured that , in extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions lung and kidney damage could occur , and that in worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney . in 2003 , the royal society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium . the           found no elevated risks of cancer generally , nor of any specific cancers in particular , though recommended follow up studies . according to the world health organization , a radiation dose from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass ; the radiological dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes.  gulf war syndrome and soldier complaints  since 1991 , the year the gulf war ended , veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems . in 1999 , assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the ministry of defence s gulf war medical assessment programme found no evidence of a single illness , physical or mental , that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group . nevertheless , in 1999 , medact petitioned for the who to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and iraqi civilians . a major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a us institute of medicine committee concluded that , because the symptoms vary greatly among individuals , they do not           though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible . . the quote is of lynn goldman , who chaired the iom committee that carried out the review . notes that despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being among gulf war veterans , exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group . likewise , there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality . simon wessely praised the iom s review , and noted that despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed , its other findings made it equally clear that service in the gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel . . the quote is of wessely himself . aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans  postwar health , because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service , another major stumbling block with some studies , like the thousand-veteran one , is that           , making general conclusions impossible . increased rates of immune system disorders and other wide-ranging symptoms , including chronic pain , fatigue and memory loss , have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 gulf war . combustion products from depleted uranium munitions are being considered as one of the potential causes by the research advisory committee on gulf war veterans  illnesses , as du was used in 30 mm and 25 mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the gulf war . veterans of the conflicts in the persian gulf , bosnia and kosovo have been found to have up to 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities in their genes . serum-soluble genotoxic teratogens produce congenital disorders , and in white blood cells causes immune system damage . human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to du . after examination of children s medical records two years later , the birth defect rate increased by more than 20% : in early 2004 , the uk pensions appeal           gulf war combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning . looking at the risk of children of uk gulf war veterans suffering genetic diseases such as congenital malformations , commonly called birth defects , one study found that the overall risk of any malformation was 50% higher in gulf war veterans as compared to other veterans . the u.s. army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten , which the u.s. navy has used in place of du since 1993 . studies by the u.s. armed forces radiobiology research institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant toxicological threat . in 2003 professor brian spratt frs , chairman of the royal society s working group on depleted uranium , said : the question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question , and the coalition needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed . a 2008 review           medline through to the end of 2007 , including multiple cohort studies of veterans , found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to du , and that the overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of gulf war and balkans veterans . though a more comprehensive assessment is possible , a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding italian soldiers who had served in the balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers , a finding consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of iraq , bosnia , and kosovo , where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used . one particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of du from shrapnel wounds . a laboratory study on rats produced by the armed forces radiobiology research institute showed that , after a study period of 6 months , rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets , comparable to the average levels in the urine of           a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group . substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their brains and central nervous systems , and showed a significant reduction of neuronal activity in the hippocampus in response to external stimuli . the conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought . results from computer-based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy .  iraqi population  since 2001 , medical personnel at the basra hospital in southern iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the gulf war . iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of du , an opinion that was echoed by several newspapers . in 2004 , iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country . in 2003 , the royal society called for western militaries to disclose where and how much du they had           , studies could be undertaken out in affected areas . . the international coalition to ban uranium weapons likewise urged that an epidemiological study be made in the basra region , as asked for by iraqi doctors , but no peer-reviewed study has yet been undertaken in basra . a medical survey , cancer , infant mortality and birth sex ratio in fallujah , iraq 20052009 published in july 2010 , states that the increases in cancer and birth defectsare alarmingly high and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6% . the group compares the dramatic increase , five years after the actual war 2004 , or exposure , with the lymphoma italian peacekeepers developed after the balkan wars , and the increased cancer risk in certain parts of sweden due to the chernobyl fallout . the origin and time of introduction of the carcinogenic agent causing the genetic stress the group will address in a separate report . the report mentions depleted uranium as one potentially relevant exposure but makes no conclusions on the source . four studies in the second half of 2012one of which described           genetic damage in any population ever studied renewed calls for the us and uk to investigate the possible links between their military assault on the city in 2004 and the explosion in deformities , cancers , and other serious health problems , even though no depleted uranium was found in soil samples taken from fallujah.  the balkans  in 2001 , the world health organization reported that data from kosovo was inconclusive and called for further studies . a 2003 study by the united nations environment programme in bosnia and herzegovina stated that low levels of contaminate were found in drinking water and air particulate at du penetrator impact points . the levels were stated as not a cause for alarm . yet , pekka haavisto , chairman of the unep du projects stated , the findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation . a team of italian scientists from the university of siena reported in 2005 that although du was clearly added to the soil in the study area , the phenomenon was very           natural range of the element in soils . moreover , the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied .  contamination as a result of the afghan war  the canadian uranium medical research centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in jalalabad that showed concentrations of 80400 ng/l of undepleted uranium , far higher than the typical concentration in the british population of 5 ng/l.  studies indicating negligible effects  studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that du ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects . a 1999 literature review conducted by the rand corporation stated : no evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium , whether inhaled or ingested , even at very high doses , and a rand report authored by the u.s. defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating du hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific . a 2001 oncology study concluded that the present scientific consensus is that du exposure to humans , in           to give rise to cancer induction . former nato secretary general lord robertson stated in 2001 that the existing medical consensus is clear . the hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited , and limited to very specific circumstances . a 2002 study from the australian defense ministry concluded that there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries .. studies of gulf war veterans show that , in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury , it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels , but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up . pier roberto danesi , then-director of the international atomic energy agency seibersdorf +laboratory , stated in 2002 that there is a consensus now that du does not represent a health threat . a 2005 study by sandia national laboratories  al marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 gulf war . marshall s           exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics . marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium . chemical effects , including potential reproductive issues , associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper .  atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions  elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the uk atomic weapons establishment at several monitoring sites in britain . these elevated readings appear to coincide with operation anaconda in afghanistan , and the shock and awe bombing campaign at the start of the second gulf war .  other contamination cases  on october 4 , 1992 , an el al boeing 747-f cargo aircraft flight 1862 , crashed into an apartment building in amsterdam . local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires . authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by           evidence to link depleted uranium to any of the reported health complaints .  safety and environmental issues  about 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as uranium hexafluoride , uf 6 , in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants . each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes of uf 6 . in the u.s. alone , 560,000 tonnes of depleted uf 6 had accumulated by 1993 . in 2005 , 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near portsmouth , ohio , oak ridge , tennessee , and paducah , kentucky. , the long-term storage of duf 6 presents environmental , health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . when uf 6 is exposed to moist air , it reacts with the water in the air and produces uo 2 f 2 and hf ,           cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks . the estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades . there have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the united states . the vulnerability of duf 6 storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports . however , the u.s. government has been converting duf 6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal . disposing of the whole duf 6 inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars .
in the 1980s the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services did on the public switched telephone network , and conceived an end-to-end circuit switched services , known as broadband integrated services digital network . before b-isdn , the original isdn attempted to substitute the analog telephone system with a digital system which was appropriate for both voice and non-voice traffic . obtaining worldwide agreement on the basic rate interface standard was expected to lead to a large user demand for isdn equipment , hence leading to mass production and inexpensive isdn chips . however , the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly . once the isdn standard was finally agreed upon and products were available , it was already obsolete . for home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer , but the isdn basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity . for business , isdn s 64 kbit/s data rate compared unfavorably to 10 mbit/s local area networks such as ethernet . this led to introduction           the term had a meaning in physics and engineering , the ccitt defined it as : qualifying a service or system requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate referring to the primary rate which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 mbit/s . services envisioned included video telephone and video conferencing . technical papers were published in early 1988 . standards were issued by the comit consultatif international tlphonique et tlgraphique , and called recommendations . they included g.707 to g.709 , and i.121 which defined the principal aspects of b-isdn , with many others following through the 1990s . the designated technology for b-isdn was asynchronous transfer mode , which was intended to carry both synchronous voice and asynchronous data services on the same transport . the b-isdn vision has been overtaken by other disruptive technologies used in the internet . the atm technology survived as a low-level layer in most digital subscriber line technologies , and as a payload type in some wireless technologies such as           any digital internet access service .

the united states presidential election of 1844 was the 15th quadrennial presidential election , held from friday , november 1 , to wednesday , december 4 , 1844 . democrat james k. polk defeated whig henry clay in a close contest that turned on the controversial issue of slavery expansion through the annexation of the republic of texas . the general election of 1844 took place in the midst of increasingly bitter congressional disputes over anti-slavery agitation , raising questions as to whether free-soil and slave-soil interests could coexist within a democratic republic . the campaign themes arose in direct response to incumbent president john tyler s pursuit of texas annexation as a slave state so as to undermine the unity of the whig and democratic parties in his bid to retain the white house . the whig party nominee henry clay adopted an anti-annexation platform on the principle of preserving north-south sectional unity and to avoid war by respecting mexico s claims to texas . clay s attempts to finesse his anti-annexation position on texas alienated many voters in the south and west where annexation support was           to the anti-slavery liberty party . democrat martin van buren , his party s presumptive presidential contender , was ousted at the democratic national convention , failing to meet the demands of southern democrat expansionists for a leader favoring the immediate acquisition of texas . democrat james k. polk emerged as america s first dark horse nominee running on a platform that embraced america s popular commitment to territorial expansionism , referred to as manifest destiny . polk successfully linked the us-british boundary dispute over the partition of oregon territory , with the divisive texas annexation debate . in doing so , the democratic party nominee united the anti-slavery northern expansionists , who demanded oregon as free-soil , with pro-slavery southern expansionists , who insisted on acquiring texas as a slave state . in doing so , polk narrowly outpolled the whig party nominee clay by thirty-eight thousand votes . party alliances were shaken by the texas controversy , but partisan loyalties among congressional democrats were rallied sufficiently in the aftermath of polk s victory to pass a joint house-senate resolution on texas annexation . texas would enter the union as           presidential election to be held on different days in different states . starting with the presidential election of 1848 , all states held the election on the same date in november . it is also the only presidential election in which the winner , polk , lost both his birth state of north carolina and his state of residence , tennessee .  background   gag rule and texas annexation controversies  whigs and democrats embarked upon their campaigns during the climax of the congressional gag rule controversies in 1844 , during which southern congressmen had suppressed northern petitions to end the slave trade in the district of columbia . anti-annexation petitions to congress sent from northern anti-slavery forces , including state legislatures had been similarly suppressed . intraparty sectional compromises and maneuvering on slavery politics during these divisive debates had placed significant strain on the northern and southern wings that comprised each political organization . the question as to whether the institution of slavery and its aristocratic principles of social authority were compatible with democratic republicanism was becoming a permanent issue in national politics . in 1836 , a           declared its independence to form the republic of texas . texans , mostly white immigrants from the deep south , many of whom owned slaves , sought to bring their republic into the union as a state . during the eight years since the texas republic had declared its independence from mexico , the subject of annexing texas to the united states was shunned by both major american political parties . though recognizing texas sovereignty , presidents andrew jackson and martin van buren would decline to pursue annexation . the prospect of bringing another slave state into the union was fraught with problems . both major parties the democrats and whigs viewed texas statehood as not worth a foreign war with mexico or the sectional combat that annexation would provoke in the united states .  tyler-texas treaty  the incumbent us president john tyler of virginia , formerly vice-president , had ascended to the white house upon the death of william henry harrison in 1841 . tyler , a whig in name only , emerged as a states  rights advocate committed           . vetoing the whig domestic legislative agenda , he was expelled from his own party on september 13 , 1841 . politically isolated but unencumbered by party restraints , tyler aligned himself with a small faction of texas annexationists in a bid for reelection in 1844 . tyler became convinced that great britain had encouraged a texas-mexico rapprochement that might lead to slave emancipation in the texas republic . accordingly , he directed secretary of state abel p. upshur of virginia to initiate , then relentlessly pursued , secret annexation talks with texas minister to the united states isaac van zandt , beginning on october 16 , 1843 . tyler submitted his texas-us treaty for annexation to the us senate , delivered april 22 , 1844 , where a two-thirds majority was required for ratification . the newly appointed secretary of state john c. calhoun of south carolina included a document known as the packenham letter with the tyler bill that was calculated to inject a sense of crisis in southern democrats of the deep south . in it , he characterized           as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the peculiar institution in the united states . in doing so , tyler and calhoun sought to unite the south in a crusade that would present the north with an ultimatum : support texas annexation or lose the south . anti-slavery whigs considered texas annexation particularly egregious since mexico had outlawed slavery in coahuila y tejas in 1829 , before texas independence had been declared . historian william lee miller points out that the significance of acquiring texas  annexing  it now became quite different after the mexican government abolished slavery in 1829 , after which the expansionist impulse included an overt reference to slavery . the 1844 presidential campaigns evolved within the context of this struggle over texas annexation , explicitly tied to the question of slavery expansion and national security . all candidates in 1844 presidential election had to declare a position on this explosive issue .  nominations   whig party convention and campaign  whig candidates senator henry clay of kentucky , effectively the leader of the whig party since its inception in 1834 was selected as the           , maryland on may 1 , 1844 . clay , a slaveholder , presided over a party in which its southern wing was sufficiently committed to the national platform to put partisan loyalties above slavery expansionist proposals that might undermine its north-south alliance . whigs felt confident that clay could duplicate harrison s landslide victory of 1840 against any opposition candidate . southern whigs feared that , with the acquisition of texas  fertile lands would produce a huge market for slave labor , inflating the price of slaves and deflating land values in their home states . northern whigs feared that texas statehood would initiate the opening of a vast empire for slavery . two weeks before the whig convention in baltimore , in reaction to calhoun s packenham letter , clay issued a document known as the raleigh letter presenting his views on texas to his fellow southern whigs . in it , he flatly denounced the tyler annexation bill and predicted that its passage would provoke a war with mexico , whose government had never recognized texas independence . clay underlined           , he would block annexation in the event that substantial sectional opposition existed anywhere in the united states . the whig party leadership was acutely aware that any proslavery legislation advanced by its southern wing would alienate its anti-slavery northern wing and cripple the party in the general election . in order to preserve their party , whigs would need to stand squarely against acquiring a new slave state . as such , whigs were content to restrict their 1844 campaign platform to less divisive issues such as internal improvements and national finance . whigs picked theodore frelinghuysen of new jersey the christian statesman as clay s running mate . an advocate of colonization of emancipated slaves , he was acceptable to southern whigs as an opponent of the abolitionists . his pious reputation balanced clay s image as a slave-holding , hard-drinking duelist . their party slogan was the bland hurray , hurray , the country s risin  vote for clay and frelinghuysen !  henry clay s alabama letter  on july 27 , 1844 , henry clay , in the midst of his campaign against james k.           letter . in it , he counseled his whig constituency to regard texas annexation and statehood as merely a short phase in the decline of slavery in the united states , rather than a long term advance for the slavepower . clay qualified his stance on texas annexation , declaring no personal objection to the annexation of the republic . he would move back to his original orientation in september 1844 . northern whigs expressed outrage at any dtente with the slavepower . failing to evince single-mindedness , they accused him of eqivocating on texas annexation . clay s central position , however , had not altered : no annexation without northern acquiescence . clay s commitment brought southern whigs under extreme pressure in their home states and congressional districts , threatening to tarnish their loyalty to slavery credentials .  whig party campaign tactics  historian sean wilentz describes some the whig campaign tactics : the liberty party added to the confusion ... clay became the object of nasty abolitionist attacks . one notorious handbill , widely reprinted , by an abolitionist minister abel j. brown  democratic party campaign           and chief architect of the jacksonian democracy was presumptive democratic presidential contender in the spring of 1844 . with calhoun withdrawing his bid for the presidency in january 1844 , the campaign was expected to focus on domestic issues . all this changed with the tyler treaty . van buren regarded the tyler annexation measure as an attempt to sabotage his bid for the white house by exacerbating the already strained democratic north-south alliance regarding slavery expansion . calhoun s packenham letter would serve to spur democrats of the south to the task of forcing the northern wing of the party to submit to texas annexation , despite the high risk of aggressively injecting slavery   into   their political campaign over texas .  van buren s hammet letter  van buren realized that accommodating slavery expansionists in the south would open the northern democrats to withering charges of appeasement to the slavepower from the strongly anti-annexation northern whigs and some democrats . he crafted an emphatically anti-texas position that temporized with expansionist southern democrats , laying out a highly conditional scenario that delayed texas annexation indefinitely .           , he counseled his party to reject texas under a tyler administration . furthermore , annexation of texas as a territory would proceed , tentatively , under a van buren administration , only when the american public had been consulted on the matter and mexico s cooperation had been pursued to avoid an unnecessary war . a military option might be advanced if a groundswell of popular support arose for texas , certified with a congressional mandate . in these respects , martin van buren differed from henry clay , who would never tolerate annexation without mexico s assent . with the publication of clay s raleigh letter and van buren s hammett letter , van burenite democrats hoped that their candidate s posture on texas would leave southern pro-annexationists with exactly one choice for us president : martin van buren . in this , they misapprehended the political situation . tyler and the southern pro-annexationists posed a potentially far greater threat then clay , in that the tyler-calhoun treaty would put immense pressure on the northern democrats to comply with southern democrats demands for texas           deep south extremists who had responded favorably to calhoun s pakenham letter . a minority phlanx of the southern democrat leadership remained obdurate that northern democratic legislators would , when exposed to sufficient southern pressure , ignore their constituents opposition to slavery expansion and unite in support of texas annexation . the extent to which southern democrat support for martin van buren had eroded over texas annexation crisis became evident when van buren s southern counterpart in the rise of the democratic party , thomas ritchie of the   richmond enquirer   , terminated their 20-year political alliance in favor of immediate annexation .  andrew jackson  secretary of state john c. calhoun , a political outsider like john tyler , gained significant credibility when his former nemesis , ex-president andrew jackson publicly announced his support for immediate texas annexation in may 1844 . old hickory had facilitated tyler s texas negotiations in february 1844 by reassuring president of the texas republic sam houston that the us senate ratification of the tyler treaty was likely . as the senate debated the tyler treaty , jackson           be respected , and any delay would result in a british balkanized texas republic , promoting slave emancipation and posing a foreign military threat to the southwest united states . the former military hero went further , urging all jacksonian democrats to block martin van buren from the party ticket and seek a democratic presidential candidate fully committed to the immediate annexation of texas . in doing so , jackson abandoned the jeffersonian-jacksonian formula that had characterized his party since the 1820s which had required its northern and southern wings to compromise on constitutional slavery disputes . texas was fracturing van buren s support among democrats and would derail his bid for president of the united states  democratic party convention  democratic candidates **20;9576;gallery **29;9598;toolong governor james k. polk of tennessee

james buchanan of pennsylvania **31;9736;toolong of state john c. calhoun of south carolina in 1840 , the democratic party convention had adopted a simple majority principle for nominee selection . northern democrat van burenites arrived           expectation that , possessing a majority of the delegates , they would quickly secure the candidacy for their man . early in proceedings , senator robert j. walker of mississippi , in cooperation with senator james buchanan of pennsylvania , called for the reinstatement of the traditional 1832 and 1834 convention rule requiring a two-thirds majority for nomination . following a historical pattern in which a minority faction of northern democrats delivered votes to produce southern wing victories for pro-slavery legislation , the van burenite delegates split over the pivotal vote . fully one-third of the pro-van buren delegates voted to reinstate the two-thirds rule , along with 90 of 104 anti-van buren delegates , producing a final vote of 148 to 116 . van buren supporters persisted in spite of this setback , garnering 146 votes for their candidate on the first ballot , a 55% simple majority , but short of the now required 177 votes . middle and deep south pro-annexationists opposed van buren 75           for victory . support for van buren dwindled in subsequent ballots from 146 to 99 , at which point van burenites were reduced to blocking nominations of numerous candidates , among them james buchanan , lewis cass of michigan , john c. calhoun and levi woodbury of new hampshire . southern intransigence had succeeded in eliminating van buren and his principled stand on texas annexation . if the democratic party was to avoid dissolution at a national level , an acceptable nominee , fully committed to immediate annexation would be required , yet capable of unifying the party in the general election .  james k. polk : dark horse  southern democrats benefited from the tyler-calhoun machinations in eliminating martin van buren as a presidential candidate , and clearing the way for the pro-annexation nationalist polk . on the eighth ballot , polk was offered to the convention as an acceptable alternative for all democratic factions at odds over the texas annexation crisis . despite polk s fervent advocacy for annexation , he had remained loyal to van buren throughout the texas controversy , and anti-annexationist van burenites were willing           him as a suitable vice-presidential choice to have complimented a van buren ticket . despite whig efforts to cast polk as an unknown who is james k. polk they asked rhetorically he was respected as an effective political operator . his sobriquet the young hickory contained a dual reference , one to his mentor andrew old hickory jackson , and one to the term young america , a reference to an international movements struggling to establish republican forms of government and the overthrow of monarchies and ascribed to manifest destiny democrats . james k. polk , a slaveholder , never enunciated a slavery expansionist position with respect to texas annexation , as had john c. calhoun and the southern extremists . as a national imperialist , he exhibited an unwavering support for manifest destiny , perceived as a non-sectional devotion to expansionism , whether slave-soil texas or free-soil oregon territory . polk s political reputation was expected to diffuse northern democratic resentment towards the slavepower , while delivering texas to the deep south . on may 29 , 1844 , polk was confirmed unanimously on the ninth ballot as the democratic           s decision to unite under a pro-annexation candidate , and worked to win new york state for polk . the anti-annexationist silas wright , us senator from new york , was offered the nomination for polk s vice-presidential running mate . wright declined on principle , and the convention settled on george m. dallas , a conservative from pennsylvania .  democratic party campaign tactics  historian sean wilentz describes some the democrat campaign tactics :  senate vote on the tyler-texas treaty  the tyler-texas annexation treaty , submitted to the senate in april 1844 , was defeated in the whig controlled senate , largely along partisan lines , 16 to 35 a two-thirds majority against passage on june 8 , 1844 . whigs voted 27-1 against the treaty : all northern whig senators voted nay , and fourteen of fifteen southern whig senators had joined them . democrats voted for the treaty 15-8 , with a slight majority of northern democrats opposing . southern democrats affirmed the treaty 10-1 , with only one slave state senator , thomas hart benton , voting against . three days later , tyler           the supermajority requirement for senate treaty approval . substituting the constitutional protocols for admitting regions of the united states into the union as states , tyler proposed that alternative , yet constitutional , means be used to bring the republic of texas a foreign country into the union . tyler and calhoun , formerly staunch supporters of minority safeguards based on the supermajority requirements for national legislation , now altered their position to facilitate passage of the tyler treaty . tyler s attempt to evade the senate vote launched a spirited congressional debate .  national democratic-republican party campaign and convention    tyler and texas   when the senate closed session debates on the tyler-texas treaty were leaked to the public on april 27 , 1844 , tyler s only hope of success in influencing passage of the his treaty was to intervene directly as candidate in the 1844 election as kingmaker . his democratic-republican party a recycling of thomas jefferson s party name held its convention on may 27 , 1844 in baltimore , maryland , a short distance from the unfolding democratic party convention that would           the same day without challenge , accepting the honor on may 30 , 1844 . he designated no vice-president as running mate . democratic party nominee james k. polk was faced with the possibility that a tyler ticket might shift votes away from the democrats and provide whig henry clay with the margin of victory in a close race . tyler made clear in his convention acceptance speech that his overriding concern was the ratification of his texas annexation treaty . moreover , he hinted that he would drop out of the race when that end was assured , informing polk , through senator robert j. walker , that his campaign efforts were simply a vehicle to mobilize support for texas annexation . tyler concentrated his resources in the states of new york , pennsylvania and new jersey , all highly contested states in the election . securing enough democratic support , his withdrawal might prove indispensable to polk . polk was receptive as long as tyler could withdraw without raising suspicion of a secret bargain . to solidify tyler s cooperation , polk enlisted andrew jackson to reassure tyler that           on august 20 , 1844 , tyler dropped out of the presidential race ; tylerites moved quickly to support the democratic party nominee .  other nominations  james birney ran as the anti-slavery liberty party candidate , garnering 2.3% of the popular vote , and over 8% of the vote in massachusetts , new hampshire and vermont . the votes he won were more than the difference in votes between henry clay and james k. polk ; some scholars have argued that birney s support among anti-slavery whigs in new york swung that decisive state in favor of polk . joseph smith , jr. , mayor of nauvoo , illinois , and founder of the latter day saint movement , ran as an independent . he proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands and decreasing the size and salary of the united states congress ; the closure of prisons ; the annexation of texas , oregon , and parts of canada ; the securing of international rights on high seas ; free trade ; and the re-establishment of a national bank . the campaign           carthage , il jail on june 27 , 1844.  election results  polk s adoption of manifest destiny paid dividends at the polls . no longer identified with the tyler-calhoun southern crusade for slavery , the western democrats could embrace texas annexation . the democrats enjoyed a huge upsurge in voter turnout up to 20% - over the figures from 1840 , especially in the northwest and mid-atlantic regions . the whigs showed only a 4% increase . the democrats won michigan , illinois and indiana , and nearly took ohio , where manifest destiny was strongest . in the deep south , clay lost every state to polk , a huge reversal from the 1840 race but carried most of the middle and border south . clay s waffling on texas may have cost him the 41 electoral votes in both new york and michigan . here , the former slaveholder , now abolitionist , james g. birney of the liberty party , received 15 , 812 and 3,632 , respectively , on the basis of his unwavering stand against texas annexation . polk won by a mere 5,106           3,422 out of 52,096 votes in michigan . had either of these voting blocks cast their ballots for the anti-annexationist clay , he would have defeated polk . despite this , clay s opposition to annexation and western slavery expansion served him well among northern whigs and nearly secured him the election . source : source :   the popular vote figures exclude south carolina where the electors were chosen by the state legislature rather than by popular vote .    results by state   electoral college selection   consequences  polk s election confirmed the american public s desire for westward expansion . the annexation of texas was formalized on march 1 , 1845 , before polk even took office . as feared , mexico refused to accept the annexation and the mexican-american war broke out in 1846 . with polk s main issue of texas settled , instead of demanding all of oregon , he compromised and the united states and united kingdom negotiated the oregon treaty  see also            second party system * united states house elections , 1844 * inauguration of james k. polk

mahikeng formerly , and still commonly , known as mafikeng and historically mafeking in english is the capital city of the north-west province of south africa . it is best known internationally for the siege of mafeking , the most famous engagement of the second boer war . located close to south africa s border with botswana , mahikeng is 1400km mi northeast of cape town and 260km mi west of johannesburg . in 2001 , it had a population of 49,300 . in 2007 , mafikeng was reported to have a population of 250,000 of which the cbd constitutes between 69,000 and 75,000 . it is built on the open veld at an elevation of 1500mft 0 , by the banks of the upper molopo river . the madibi goldfields are some 15km mi south of the town .  history  mahikeng is the headquarters of the people . the town was founded by molema tawana . born in khunwana during the   difaqane   period , molema was the son of kgosi           close confidant , montshiwa , later became chief . during the period that the tshidi barolong resided at thaba nchu , where they found refuge during the difaqane , molema was converted to christianity by the wesleyan missionaries based there . molema s son and heir , silas molema , was educated at healdtown college . in 1857 molema led an advance guard to scout out the area along the molopo river . this was a familiar area as they had previously lived in nearby khunwana . molema settled at mafikeng , while the main body of the barolong under montshiwa followed . but montshiwa did not feel safe at mafikeng due to the close presence and encroachment of the boers in the transvaal . he led his followers to moshaneng in the territory of the bangwaketse in present-day botswana . molema remained at mafikeng to ensure that the barolong retained a presence there .           sites in the proximity of the molopo . molema had to use all his diplomatic skills on several occasions to prevent boer incursion and settlement near mafikeng . he has been described as a man of strong personality and exceptional gifts ... and montshiwa s chief counsellor in vital matters . after negotiations with molema , montshiwa decided to return to mafikeng in 1876 . molema was a firm believer in western education , having attended healdtown ; he opened a school for the barolong once they had settled in the district . molema became a farmer and businessman , as well as advising his brother montshiwa . he died in 1882 . one of his sons , silas molema , became a doctor and historian of the barolong. . the settlement was named mafikeng , a   setswana   name meaning place of stones . later british settlers spelled the name as mafeking . the jameson raid started from pitsani pothlugo 24 mi north of mafeking on december 29 , 1895 . at the outbreak           was besieged . the siege of mafeking lasted 217 days from october 1899 to may 1900 , and turned robert baden-powell into a national hero . in september 1904 , lord roberts unveiled an obelisk at mafeking bearing the names of those who fell in defence of the town . in all , 212 people were killed during the siege , with more than 600 wounded . boer losses were significantly higher . although it was outside the protectorate s borders , mafeking served as capital of the bechuanaland protectorate from 1894 until 1965 , when gaborone was made the capital of what was to become botswana . mafeking also briefly served as capital of the pre-independence bantustan of bophuthatswana in the 1970s , before the adjoining town of mmabatho was established as capital . following a local referendum on the issue , mafeking joined bophuthatswana in 1980 , three years after bophuthatswana was awarded independence , and was renamed   mafikeng   , and treated as a suburb of mmabatho . following the end of apartheid in 1994 , the merged mafikeng and mmabatho was instated as capital           major facilities  north-west university mafikeng train station mmabatho stadium mafikeng airport mafikeng game reserve botsalano game reserve molemane eye nature reserve  name  the town s name was first spelt by british settlers as mafeking , but the name reverted to mafikeng in 1980 following its incorporation into bophuthatswana . in february 2010 , lulu xingwana , the then minister of arts and culture , approved the town s name to be changed again to mahikeng . despite this the town s anc-run local government and most local residents still refer to the town as mafikeng both informally and formally .  notable people from mahikeng  dr silas molema : medical doctor , businessman and historian of the barolong . judge yvonne mokgoro : former justice at constitutional court of south africa . credo mutwa : lived for numerous years and created arts village of lotlamoreng , located on the outskirts of mafikeng.  climate
cloud albedo is a measure of the albedo of a cloud - higher values mean that the cloud reflects more solar radiation , or less radiation is transmitted . cloud albedo varies from less than 10% to more than 90% and depends on drop sizes , liquid water or ice content , thickness of the cloud , and the sun s zenith angle . the smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content , the greater the cloud albedo , if all other factors are the same . low , thick clouds primarily reflect incoming solar radiation , causing it to have a high albedo , whereas high , thin clouds tend to transmit it to the surface but then trap outgoing infrared radiation , causing it to have low albedo . it contributes to the greenhouse effect .
birthplace = beauvais , oise , france deathplace = paris henri lon lebesgue formemrs was a french mathematician most famous for his theory of integration , which was a generalization of the 17th century concept of integrationsumming the area between an axis and the curve of a function defined for that axis . his theory was published originally in his dissertation   intgrale , longueur , aire   at the university of nancy during 1902.  personal life  henri lebesgue was born on 28 june 1875 in beauvais , oise . lebesgue s father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher . his parents assembled at home a library that the young henri was able to use . unfortunately his father died of tuberculosis when lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself . as he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school , one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education           and lyce louis-le-grand in paris . in 1894 lebesgue was accepted at the cole normale suprieure , where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics , graduating in 1897 . after graduation he remained at the cole normale suprieure for two years , working in the library , where he became aware of the research on discontinuity done at that time by ren-louis baire , a recent graduate of the school . at the same time he started his graduate studies at the sorbonne , where he learned about mile borel s work on the incipient measure theory and camille jordan s work on the jordan measure . in 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the lyce central in nancy , while continuing work on his doctorate . in 1902 he earned his ph.d . from the sorbonne with the seminal thesis on integral , length , area , submitted with borel , four years older , as advisor . lebesgue married the sister of one of his fellow students , and he and his wife had two children , suzanne and jacques . after           position at the university of rennes , lecturing there until 1906 , when he moved to the faculty of sciences of the university of poitiers . in 1910 lebesgue moved to the sorbonne as a matre de confrences , being promoted to professor starting with 1919 . in 1921 he left the sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the collge de france , where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life . in 1922 he was elected a member of the acadmie franaise . henri lebesgue died on 26 july 1941 in paris .  mathematical career  lebesgue s first paper was published in 1898 and was titled sur lapproximation des fonctions . it dealt with weierstrass  theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials . between march 1899 and april 1901 lebesgue published six notes in   comptes rendus .   the first of these , unrelated to his development of lebesgue integration , dealt with the extension of baire s theorem to functions of two variables . the next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane , the area           a given bound , and the final note gave the definition of lebesgue integration for some function f . lebesgue s great thesis ,   intgrale , longueur , aire   , with the full account of this work , appeared in the annali di matematica in 1902 . the first chapter develops the theory of measure . in the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically . the next chapters expand the   comptes rendus   notes dealing with length , area and applicable surfaces . the final chapter deals mainly with plateau s problem . this dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician . his lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a borel tract   leons sur lintgration et la recherche des fonctions primitives   . the problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book . lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context , addressing augustin-louis cauchy , peter gustav lejeune dirichlet , and           desirable that the integral should satisfy , the last of which is if the sequence f n increases to the limit f , the integral of f n tends to the integral of f . lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable functions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral . he turned next to trigonometric functions with his 1903 paper sur les sries trigonomtriques . he presented three major theorems in this work : that a trigonometrical series representing a bounded function is a fourier series , that the n th fourier coefficient tends to zero , and that a fourier series is integrable term by term . in 1904-1905 lebesgue lectured once again at the collge de france , this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the borel tracts . in this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context . he expounds on fourier series , cantor-riemann theory , the poisson           , reprsentation trigonomtrique approche des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de lipschitz deals with the fourier series of functions satisfying a lipschitz condition , with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term . he also proves that the riemannlebesgue lemma is a best possible result for continuous functions , and gives some treatment to lebesgue constants . lebesgue once wrote , rduites des thories gnrales , les mathmatiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu . in measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics , the lebesguestieltjes integral generalizes riemannstieltjes and lebesgue integration , preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure-theoretic framework . during the course of his career , lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex analysis and topology . he also had a disagreement with borel with regards to effective calculation . however , these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis ; his contributions to this field had a           his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis . additionally , he is claimed to be the last of the mathematicians to consider one to be a prime number .  lebesgue s theory of integration  this is a non-technical treatment from a historical point of view ; see the article   lebesgue integration   for a technical treatment from a mathematical point of view . integration is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the area under the graph of a function . the first theory of integration was developed by archimedes in the 3rd century bc with his method of quadratures , but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry . in the 17th century , isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to differentiation , the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph . this surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus , differentiation and integration , is now known as           to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time . however , unlike archimedes  method , which was based on euclidean geometry , mathematicians felt that newton s and leibniz s integral calculus did not have a rigorous foundation . in the 19th century , augustin cauchy developed epsilon-delta limits , and bernhard riemann followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the riemann integral . to define this integral , one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller rectangles and takes the limit of the sums of the areas of the rectangles at each stage . for some functions , however , the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number . as such , they have no riemann integral . lebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem . instead of using the areas of rectangles , which put the focus on the domain of the function , lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area . lebesgue s idea was to first define measure , for both sets           build the integral for what he called simple functions ; measurable functions that take only finitely many values . then he defined it for more complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question . lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a riemann integral also has a lebesgue integral , and for those functions the two integrals agree . furthermore , every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a lebesgue integral that have no riemann integral . as part of the development of lebesgue integration , lebesgue invented the concept of measure , which extends the idea of length from intervals to a very large class of sets , called measurable sets . lebesgue s technique for turning a measure into an integral generalises easily to many other situations , leading to the           deficient in one respect . the riemann integral generalises to the improper riemann integral to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a closed interval . the lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions , but not all of them . for functions on the real line , the henstock integral is an even more general notion of integral that subsumes both lebesgue integration and improper riemann integration . however , the henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the real line and so does not generalise to allow integration in more general spaces , while the lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally .
edith louisa cavell was a british nurse . she is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without distinction and in helping some 200 allied soldiers escape from german-occupied belgium during the first world war , for which she was arrested . she was subsequently court-martialled , found guilty of treason and sentenced to death . despite international pressure for mercy , she was shot by a german firing squad . her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage . she is well known for her statement that patriotism is not enough . her strong anglican beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it , both german and allied soldiers . she was quoted as saying , i cant stop while there are lives to be saved . 12 october is appointed for her commemoration in the anglican church , although this is not a saint s feast day in the traditional sense . edith cavell , who was 49 at the time of her execution , was already notable as a pioneer           career  edith cavell was born on 4 december 1865 in swardeston , a village near norwich , where her father was vicar for 45 years . she was the eldest of the four children of the reverend frederick and louisa sophia cavell and was taught always to share with the less fortunate , despite her familys meagre income . after a period as a governess , including for a family in brussels 18901895 , she trained as a nurse at the london hospital under matron eva luckes and worked in various hospitals in england , including shoreditch infirmary . in 1907 , cavell was recruited by dr antoine depage to be matron of a newly established nursing school , l  cole belge dinfirmires diplmes , on the rue de la culture , ixelles in brussels . by 1910 , miss cavell felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal , and therefore launched the nursing journal ,   linfirmire   . a           hospitals , 24 schools , and 13 kindergartens in belgium . when the first world war broke out , she was visiting her widowed mother in norfolk in the east of england . she returned to brussels , where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the red cross .  first world war and execution  in november 1914 , after the german occupation of brussels , cavell began sheltering british soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied belgium to the neutral netherlands . wounded british and french soldiers and belgian and french civilians of military age were hidden from the germans and provided with false papers by prince reginald de croy at his chteau of bellignies near mons. from there , they were conducted by various guides to the houses of cavell , louis sverin and others in brussels , and furnished by them with money to reach the dutch frontier and with guides obtained through philippe baucq . she was arrested on 3 august 1915 and charged with harbouring allied soldiers . she had been betrayed by gaston quien , who was later convicted by a           was prosecuted for aiding british and french soldiers , in addition to young belgian men , to cross the border and eventually enter britain . she admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial . cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when arriving safely in britain . this admission confirmed that cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the dutch frontier , but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with germany . the penalty according to german military law was death . paragraph 58 of the german military code said ; will be sentenced to death for treason any person who , with the intention of helping the hostile power , or of causing harm to the german or allied troops , is guilty of one of the crimes of paragraph 90 of the german penal code . the case referred to in the above-mentioned paragraph 90 consists of conducting soldiers to the enemy . additionally , the penalties according to paragraph 160 of the german code , in case of war ,           first geneva convention ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel , that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action . this forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the convention , which was the version in force at the time . the german authorities instead justified prosecution merely on the basis of the german law and the interests of the german state . the british government could do nothing to help her . sir horace rowland of the foreign office said , i am afraid that it is likely to go hard with miss cavell ; i am afraid we are powerless . lord robert cecil , under-secretary for foreign affairs , said , any representation by us , he advised , will do her more harm than good . the united states , however , had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure . hugh s. gibson , first secretary of the u.s. legation at brussels , made clear to the german government that executing cavell would further harm germany s already damaged reputation . later           von der lancken of the burning of leuven baron von der lancken is known to have stated that cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives , german as well as allied . however , traugott von sauberzweig cavell was not arrested for espionage , as many were led to believe , but for treason . when in custody , cavell was questioned in french , but the session was minuted in german . this gave the interrogator the opportunity to misinterpret her answers . although she may have been misrepresented , she made no attempt to defend herself . cavell was provided with a defender approved by the german military governor . a previous defender , who was chosen for cavell by her assistant , elizabeth wilkins , the night before her execution , she told the reverend stirling gahan , the anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her holy communion , patriotism is not enough . i must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone . from his sick bed brand whitlock ,           on cavell s behalf to moritz von bissing , the governor general of belgium . hugh gibson ; maitre g. de leval , the legal adviser to the united states legation ; and rodrigo saavedra y vinent , 2nd marques de villalobar , the spanish minister , formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of sentence . there is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the german military code . supposedly , the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death . on instructions from the spanish minister , belgian women immediately buried her body next to saint-gilles prison .  role in first world war propaganda  in the months and years following cavell s death , countless newspaper articles , pamphlets , images , and books publicised her story . she became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in britain , and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the allies in the united states . she was a popular icon because of her sex , her nursing profession ,           was represented as an act of german barbarism and moral depravity . news reports shortly following cavell s execution were found to be only true in part . even the   american journal of nursing   repeated the fictional account of cavell s execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad . allegedly , while she lay unconscious , the german commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver . numerous accounts like these stimulated international outrage and general anti-german sentiments . along with the invasion of belgium , and the sinking of the   rms lusitania because of the british government s decision to use cavell s story as propaganda , she became the most prominent british female casualty of first world war . the combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made cavell s case one of the most effective in british propaganda of the first world war , as well as a factor in enduring post-war anti-german sentiment . before the first world war , cavell was not well known           different depictions of her in british propaganda , which ignored anything that did not fit this image , including the suggestion that cavell , during her interrogation , had given information that incriminated others . in november 1915 , the british foreign office issued a denial that cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony . one image commonly represented was of cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy . this view depicted her as innocent of espionage , and was most commonly used in various forms of british propaganda , such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war . her story was presented in the british press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield . these images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop the murder of innocent british women . another , second , representation of cavell during the first world war saw her described as a serious , reserved , brave , and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others . this portrayal has been           of the red cross nurse . pastor le seur , the german army chaplain , recalled at the time of her execution , i do not believe that miss cavell wanted to be a martyrbut she was ready to die for her country miss cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful christian .  german response  unlike the rest of the world , the german government thought that they had acted fairly towards cavell . in a letter , german undersecretary for foreign affairs dr alfred zimmermann made a statement to the press on behalf of the german government : from the germans  perspective , had they released cavell , there would have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against germany because they knew they would not be severely punished . it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to germany and ignore the worlds condemnation . their laws do not make distinctions between sexes , the only exception to this rule being           condition could not be executed . the german government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts . the court paid particular attention to this point , releasing several accused persons because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.  burial and memorials  cavell s remains were returned to britain after the war and a state funeral was held at westminster abbey . on 19 may 1919 , her

the chico heat were a professional independent baseball team operating in chico , california in the western baseball league . they had no operating agreement with any major league baseball team . they were created by chico heat professional baseball llc , with former supermarket entrepreneur steve nettleton and his wife kathy serving as principal owners . general managers included bob linscheid and jeff kragel and their mascot was the beloved heater the dragon . the team began operations in 1997 . the team immediately won the league championship in their inaugural season and , although they did not win a championship in the four subsequent years , they won the most regular season games in each of the following seasons . they appeared in the championship series in five out of their six seasons in the league . in 2002 , chico won its second league championship in the league s and the team           , which is located on the campus of california state university , chico . they were preceded by the oroville/chico red sox of the minor league s class-c far west league from 1948-1951 and were succeeded by the chico outlaws of the independent golden baseball league , taking their place in 2005 . the heat has been the most successful professional baseball franchise in the city s history .  remember the heat night  on august 11 , 2007 , former heat majority owner steve nettleton and former heat players were honored as part of a celebration called remember the heat night hosted by the chico outlaws as they faced the st. george roadrunners . the original heat mascot heater even made an appearance . the outlaws won the ball game in front of over 3,500 fans at nettleton stadium .  alumni  notable heat alumni who would return to chico to join the outlaws organization as either a player , coach or executive include greg bicknell , scott navarro , jon macalutas and lance franks.  year-by-year record  border= 2 cellpadding= 4 cellspacing= 0 style= margin :           : 1px aaa solid ; border-collapse : collapse ; ! year ! ! league ! ! affiliation ! ! record ! ! finish ! ! manager ! ! playoffs  reference links  * * * * * * * * *
the temple mount and eretz yisrael faithful movement is an orthodox jewish movement , based in jerusalem , israel whose goal is to rebuild the third jewish temple on the temple mount in jerusalem and re-institute the practice of ritual sacrifice . the movement was founded by former israel defense forces officer and middle eastern studies lecturer gershon salomon . members of the movement are referred to as the temple mount faithful . the group was established in 1967 . on october 8 , 1990 , seventeen palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by israeli border police in the 1990 temple mount riots triggered by an announcement by the temple mount faithful that they were going to lay a cornerstone for a third jewish temple on the temple mount in jerusalem . after the riots the police prohibited salomon from entering the temple mount ; his appeal of that decision was subsequently denied by israel s high court of justice . the temple mount faithful was the first significant group to advocate the jewish takeover of the temple mount and during           with that position . initially , the group presented its argument largely in terms of nationalistic rather than religious symbolism . in a 1983 interview salomon stated that whoever controls the temple mount has rights over the land of israel . over time , gershon salomon developed a more religiously oriented apocalyptic and messianic platform , which , however , was distinctly non-orthodox in character . tensions with the more orthodox elements in the group caused a formal split in 1987 , when a more religiously-oriented splinter group , called the movement for the establishment of the temple was founded . subsequently the influence of the temple mount faithful among the radical jewish activists gradually waned , although the group still retains significant visibility . the temple mount faithful functions as a protest movement , but , unlike some other radical jewish groups , it attempts to operate within israeli law . typically , shortly before major jewish religious festivals , the group requests a permit from the israeli police to enter the temple mount compound and conduct prayer services there . these requests are routinely denied and are followed by           high court , also routinely , permits the group to enter the site but not to pray there ; and such permit is contingent on the israeli police concluding that the security situation would allow such entry . the police conclude that the entry can not be permitted for security reasons and the temple mount faithful are not allowed to enter the temple mount compound . as a result , their demonstrations usually proceed to the mograbi gate and are stopped by the police there , outside of the compound . in recent years salomon increasingly shifted the focus of the temple mount faithful in the apocalyptic and messianic direction , and restoration of the jewish temple became one of the central objectives of the movement . during the same period the movement developed close ties with christian fundamentalist circles and it receives significant financial assistance from some christian groups , particularly in the u.s.  footnotes 
ununpentium is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol uup and has the atomic number 115 . it is placed as a heavier homologue to bismuth and the heaviest member of group 15 . it was first observed in 2003 and about 50 atoms of ununpentium have been synthesized to date , with about 25 direct decays of the parent element having been detected . four consecutive isotopes are currently known , 287290 uup , with 289 uup having the longest measured half-life of 200 ms . on august 27 , 2013 , researchers at gsi from lund university in sweden reported confirming the existence of the element . on september 10 , 2013 , researchers from the same research group working in darmstadt , germany reported synthesis as well .  history   discovery profile  on february 2 , 2004 , synthesis of ununpentium was reported in   physical review c   by a team composed of russian scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research           national laboratory . the team reported that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of ununpentium . these atoms , they report , decayed by emission of alpha-particles to ununtrium in approximately 100 milliseconds. : + + 3 n + the dubnalivermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discovery of ununpentium by conducting chemical experiments on the decay daughter 268 db . in experiments in june 2004 and december 2005 , the dubnium isotope was successfully identified by milking the db fraction and measuring any sf activities . both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268 db which lends support to the assignment of z=115 to the parent nuclei . sergei dmitriev from the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions in dubna , russia , has formally put forward their claim of discovery of ununpentium to the iupac/iupap joint working party . in 2011 , the iupac evaluated the dubnalivermore results and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery .  naming  ununpentium is historically known as   eka-bismuth           temporary iupac systematic element name derived from the digits 115 , where un- represents latin   unum   . pent- represents the greek word for 5 . for more , see systematic element name .  current and future experiments  the team at dubna are currently running another series of experiments on the 243 am reaction . they are attempting to complete the 4n excitation function and confirm the data for 287 uup . they are also hoping to identify some decays from the 2n and 5n exit channels . this reaction will run until the christmas shutdown . the flnr also have future plans to study light isotopes of element 115 using the reaction 241 am + 48 ca . a team of researchers at lund university announced they had corroborated the 2004 findings in august 2013 by shooting calcium ions into a thin film of americium . researchers at the gsi helmholtz in darmstadt , germany reported the successful synthesis of ununpentium using the same reaction just two weeks later           target-projectile combinations  the table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with z=115 . each entry is a combination for which calculations have provided estimates for cross section yields from various neutron evaporation channels . the channel with the highest expected yield is given . class= wikitable style= text-align:center !

in greek mythology , the meliae were nymphs of the ash tree , whose name they shared . they appeared from the drops of blood spilled when cronus castrated uranus , according to hesiod ,   theogony   187 . from the same blood sprang the erinyes , suggesting perhaps that the ash-tree nymphs represented the fates in milder guise , and the giants . from the meliae sprang the race of mankind of the age of bronze .  description  the meliae belong to a class of sisterhoods whose nature is to appear collectively and who are invoked in the plural , though genealogical myths , especially in hesiod , give them individual names , such as melia , but these are quite clearly secondary and carry no great weight . the melia thus singled out is one of these daughters of oceanus . by her brother the river-god inachus , she became the mother of io , phoroneus , aegialeus           she was the mother of amycus by poseidon , as the olympian representative of oceanus . many species of   fraxinus   , the ash trees , exude a sugary substance , which the ancient greeks called   mli   , honey . the species of ash in the mountains of greece is the manna-ash . the meliae were nurses of the infant zeus in the cretan cave of dikte , according to callimachus ,   hymn to zeus   . they fed him honey . of manna , the ash-tree sugar , the standard 19th-century us pharmacopeia ,   the dispensatory of the united states of america   said : fermented honey preceded wine as an entheogen in the aegean world .  meliae  the meliai were perhaps the same as the honey-nymph nurses of the god zeus , ida and adrasteia . the manna meli of the ash and the honey of bees were thought to be related and being regarded           s   theogony   they were born aside the erinyes , avengers of the castration of uranus , and the gigantes . in hesiod appear to be the kouretes-protectors of the baby zeus . as children born of the castration , it would be proper that they are brothers should play a role in the downfall of cronus , performer of the crime . they were an overly aggressive race who incurred the wrath of zeus and were ruined in the flood of the great deluge .  argive genealogy in greek mythology

infobox settlement new london is a seaport city and a port of entry on the northeast coast of the united states . it is located at the mouth of the thames river in new london county , southeastern connecticut . new london is located about 107 mi from boston , massachusetts , 56 mi from providence , rhode island , 85 mi from new bedford , massachusetts , and about 128 mi from new york city . for several decades beginning in the early 19th century , new london was the world s third busiest whaling port after new bedford , massachusetts , and nantucket . the wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city s present architecture . new london subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries , but has gradually lost its commercial and industrial heart . the city is home to connecticut college , mitchell college , the united states coast guard academy , and the williams school . new london harbor is home port to the u.s. coast guard cutter                 . new london had a population of 27,620 at the 2010 census . the norwich-new london metropolitan area includes twenty-one towns and 274,055 people .  history  the area was called nameaug by the pequot indians . john winthrop , jr . founded the first english settlement here in 1646 , making it about the 13th town settled in connecticut . inhabitants informally named it pequot after the tribe . the connecticut general assembly wanted to name the town faire harbour , but the citizens protested , declaring that they would prefer it to be called nameaug . the legislature relented , and on march 10 , 1658 the town was officially named after london , england . the harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on long island sound , and consequently new london became a base of american naval operations during the revolutionary war . famous new londoners during the american revolution include nathan hale , william coit , richard douglass , thomas &amp; nathaniel shaw , gen. samuel parsons , printer timothy green , reverend seabury . new london           6 , 1781 in the battle of groton heights , by norwich native benedict arnold in an attempt to destroy the revolutionary privateer fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city . it is often noted that this raid on new london and groton was to divert general washington and the french army under rochambeau from their march on yorktown , virginia . the main defensive fort for new london , fort griswold , located across the thames river in groton , was well known to arnold , who sold its secrets to the british fleet so they could avoid its artillery fire . after overrunning new london s fort trumbull , ft . griswold was attacked by the british , who suffered great casualties before eventually storming the fort and slaughtering many of the militia who defended the fort . all told more than 52 british soldiers and 83 militia were killed and more than 142 british and 39 militia were wounded , many mortally . new london suffered over 6 militia killed and 24 wounded while arnold and the british and hessian raiding party suffered an           richard douglass house on green street image:park next to the day newspaper img1029.jpgsmall park next to   new london day   newspaper file:citizen s bank in new london , ct.jpgcitizen s bank in new london file:another view of downtown new london , ct.jpganother view of downtown new london image : newlondonct statest 1920. jpgstate street connecticut s independent legislature , in its january session of 1784 , made new london one of the first two cities brought from   de facto   to formalized incorporations . for several decades beginning in the early 19th century , new london was the second busiest whaling port after new bedford , massachusetts in the world . the wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city s present architecture . the new haven and new london railroad connected new london by rail to new haven and points beyond by the 1850s . the springfield and new london railroad connected new london to springfield , massachusetts by the 1870s . several military installations           have been part of new london s history . most of these have been located at fort trumbull . the first fort trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the revolutionary war . the second fort trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands . by 1910 the fort s defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the endicott program , primarily located on fishers island . the fort was turned over to the revenue cutter service and became the revenue cutter academy . the revenue cutter service was merged into the united states coast guard in 1915 , and the academy relocated to its current site in 1932 . during world war ii the merchant marine officers training school was located at fort trumbull . from 1950 to 1990 fort trumbull was the location for the naval underwater sound laboratory , which developed sonar and related systems for us navy submarines . in 1990 the sound laboratory was merged with the naval underwater systems center in newport , rhode island , and in 1996 the new london facility was closed . although the naval submarine           were stationed in new london from 1951 to 1991 . the submarine tender   fulton   and submarine squadron ten were at state pier during this time . squadron ten was usually composed of ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron . in the 1990s state pier was rebuilt as a container terminal . the family of nobel laureate and pulitzer prize-winning playwright eugene oneill , and most of his own first 26 years , were intimately connected to new london . he lived for years there , and as an adult was employed and wrote his first seven or eight plays in the city . a major oneill archive is located at connecticut college , and a family home there is a museum and registered national historic landmark operated by the   eugene oneill theater center   . dutch s tavern on green street was a favorite watering hole of eugene oneill and still stands today .  towns created from new london  when established , new london originally had a larger land area . towns set off since include           groton ) created from a part of groton in 1836 * montville in 1786 ** salem created from parts of montville , colchester and lyme in 1819 * waterford in 1801 ** east lyme created from parts of waterford and lyme in 1839 * fishers island officially left connecticut and became part of new york in 1879.  geography  in terms of land area , new london is one of the smallest cities in connecticut . of the whole 10.76 sqmi , nearly half is water ; 5.54 sqmi is land . the town and city of new london are coextensive . between 1705 and 1801 sections of the original town were ceded to form newer towns . the towns of groton , ledyard , montville , and waterford ;

a detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleaning properties in dilute solutions . these substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates , a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water , because the polar sulfonate is less likely than the polar carboxyl to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water . in most household contexts , the term   detergent   by itself refers specifically to   laundry detergent   or   dish detergent   , as opposed to   hand soap   or other types of cleaning agents . detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions . detergents , like soaps , work because they are amphiphilic : partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic . their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds with water . because air is not hydrophilic , detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees .  chemical classification of           depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants.  anionic detergents  typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates . the alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic . two different varieties have been popularized , those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups . the former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable . an estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets . bile acids , such as deoxycholic acid , are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils .  cationic detergents  cationic detergents are similar to the anionic ones , with a hydrophobic component , but , instead of the anionic sulfonate group , the cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end . the ammonium center is positively charged .  non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents  non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged , hydrophilic headgroups . typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside . common examples of the former include tween           are also known as ethoxylates or pegylates and their metabolites , nonylphenol . glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup . examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides . hega and mega series detergents are similar , possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup . zwitterionic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and 1 charged chemical groups . examples include chaps . see surfactants for more applications .  major applications of detergents   laundry detergents  one of the largest applications of detergents is for washing clothes . the formulations are complex , reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market . in general , laundry detergents contain water softeners , surfactants , bleach , enzymes , brighteners , fragrances , and many other agents . the formulation is strongly affected by the temperature of the cleaning water and varies from country to country .  fuel additives  both carburetors and fuel injector components of otto engines benefit from detergents in the fuels to prevent fouling . concentrations are about 300 ppm . typical           **30;4944;toolong  biological reagent  reagent grade detergents are employed for the isolation and purification of integral membrane proteins found in biological cells . advancements in the purity and sophistication of detergents have facilitated structural and biophysical characterization of important membrane proteins such as ion channels , transporters , signaling receptors , and photosystem ii .  soapless soap  soapless soap refers to a soapfree liquid cleanser with a slightly acidic ph . soapless soaps are used in an array of products .

in new guinea mythology , papare is the lunar deity .
green anarchism or eco-anarchism , is a school of thought within anarchism which puts a particular emphasis on environmental issues . an important early influence was the thought of the american anarchist henry david thoreau and his book   walden   as well as leo tolstoy and lise reclus . in the late 19th century there emerged anarcho-naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in france , spain , cuba and portugal . important contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology .  early ecoanarchism   henry david thoreau  anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of american anarchist and transcendentalist henry david thoreau . in his book   walden   he advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization . the work is part personal declaration of independence , social experiment , voyage of spiritual discovery , satire , and manual for self-reliance . first published in 1854 , it details thoreau s experiences over the course of two years , two months           walden pond , amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor ralph waldo emerson , near concord , massachusetts . the book compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development . by immersing himself in nature , thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection . simple living and self-sufficiency were thoreau s other goals , and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy , a central theme of the american romantic period . as thoreau made clear in his book , his cabin was not in wilderness but at the edge of town , about two miles from his family home . a such many have seen in thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in john zerzan . for george woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of american society in the mid xix century . john zerzan himself included the text excursions by           against civilization : readings and reflections   from 1999.  lise reclus  lise reclus , also known as jacques lise reclus , was a renowned french geographer , writer and anarchist . he produced his 19-volume masterwork   la nouvelle gographie universelle , la terre et les hommes   , over a period of nearly 20 years . in 1892 he was awarded the prestigious gold medal of the paris geographical society for this work , despite his having been banished from france because of his political activism . according to kirkpatrick sale : for the authors of an anarchist faq reclus argued that a secret harmony exists between the earth and the people whom it nourishes , and when imprudent societies let themselves violate this harmony , they always end up regretting it . similarly , no contemporary ecologist would disagree with his comments that the truly civilised man and women understands that his or her nature is bound up with the interest of all and with that of nature .           and works to improve his domain . reclus advocated nature conservation and opposed meat-eating and cruelty to animals . he was a vegetarian . as a result , his ideas are seen by some historians as anticipating the modern social ecology and animal rights movements . shortly before his death , reclus completed   lhomme et la terre   . in it , he added to his previous greater works by considering humanity s development relative to its geographical environment . reclus was also an early proponent of naturism.  anarcho-naturism  in the late 19th century anarchist naturism appeared as the union of anarchist and naturist philosophies . mainly it had importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain , france , portugal , and cuba . anarcho-naturism advocated vegetarianism , free love , nudism and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them . anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview , small ecovillages , and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity . naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological , physical           important promoters of this were henri zisly and emile gravelle who collaborated in   la nouvelle humanit   followed by   le naturien   ,   le sauvage   ,   lordre naturel   , &amp;   la vie naturelle     france   richard d. sonn comments on the influence of naturist views in the wider french anarchist movement : zisly s political activity , primarily aimed at supporting a return to  natural life  through writing and practical involvement , stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment . zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization , which he regarded as  absurd , ignoble , and filthy .  he openly opposed industrialization , arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian , defended nudism , advocated a non-dogmatic and non-religious adherence to the  laws of nature ,  recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency , and disagreed with vegetarianism , which he considered  anti-scientific.    cuba   the historian kirwin r. schaffer in his study of cuban anarchism           anarchist movement alongside anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism . naturism was a global alternative health and lifestyle movement . naturists focused on redefining one s life to live simply , eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets , and raise one s own food if possible . the countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living , and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism . globally , the naturist movement counted anarchists , liberals , and socialists as its followers . however , in cuba a particular anarchist dimension evolved led by people like adrin del valle , who spearheaded the cuban effort to shift naturism s focus away from only individual health to naturism having a social emancipatory function . schaffer reports the influence that anarcho-naturism had outside naturists circles . so for instance , nothing inherently prevented an anarcho-syndicalist in the havana restaurant workers  union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as revolutionary . . anarcho-naturists promoted a rural ideal , simple living , and being in harmony with nature as ways to           . besides promoting an early twentieth-century back-to-the-land movement , they used these romantic images of nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony . the main propagandizer in cuba of anarcho-naturism was the catalonia born adrin del valle ... over the following decades , del valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in cuba but also mainstream literary publications ... from 1912 to 1913 he edited the freethinking journal   el audaz   . then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho-naturist line   pro-vida   .   spain   anarcho-naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in the spanish anarchist movement in france , later important propagandists of anarcho-naturism include henri zisly and mile gravelle whose ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in spain , where federico urales promoted the ideas of gravelle and zisly in            the relation between anarchism and naturism gives way to the naturist federation , in july 1928 , and to the lv spanish naturist congress , in september 1929 , both supported by the libertarian movement . however , in the short term , the naturist and libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life . the naturist movement felt closer to the libertarian individualism of some french theoreticians such as henri ner than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some anarchist organisations such as the fai , . this ecological tendency in spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the cntfai in spain . daniel gurin in   anarchism : from theory to practice   reports :   isaac puente   isaac puente was an influential spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s and an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism , was a militant of both the cnt anarcho-syndicalist trade union and iberian anarchist federation . he published the book   el comunismo libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y           and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims   ) in 1933 , which sold around 100,000 copies , and wrote the final document for the extraordinary confederal congress of zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the cnt for that year . puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view . he saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes , alongside neo-malthusianism , and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being . he believed capitalist societies endangered the well-being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint , and promoted anarcho-communism alongside naturism as a solution .   other countries   naturism also met anarchism in the united kingdom . in many of the alternative communities established in britain in the early 1900s nudism , anarchism , vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life . in the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at whiteway , near stroud in gloucestershire , shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless           the italian anarchist federation in carrara in 1965 , a group decided to split off from this organization and created the   gruppi di iniziativa anarchica   . in the seventies , it was mostly composed of veteran individualist anarchists with an orientation of pacifism , naturism , etc , .. . american anarcho-syndicalist sam dolgoff shows some of the criticism that some people on the other anarchist currents at the time had for anarcho-naturist tendencies . speaking of life at the stelton colony of new york in the 1930s , noted with disdain that it , like other colonies , was infested by vegetarians , naturists , nudists , and other cultists , who sidetracked true anarchist goals . one resident always went barefoot , ate raw food , mostly nuts and raisins , and refused to use a tractor , being opposed to machinery , and he did nt want to abuse horses , so he dug the earth himself . such self-proclaimed anarchists were in reality ox-cart anarchists , dolgoff said , who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life . in an           grumbled , i am sick and tired of these half-assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons . .  leo tolstoy and tolstoyanism  russian christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist leo tolstoy is also recognized as an early influence in green anarchism . the novelist was struck by the description of christian , buddhist , and hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness . after reading passages such as the following , which abound in schopenhauer s ethical chapters , the russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will :    but this very necessity of involuntary suffering for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the savior : it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god . therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation , chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in           but voluntarily took to the mendicant s staff ; and francis of assisi , the founder of the mendicant orders who , as a youngster at a ball , where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together , was asked : now francis , will you not soon make your choice from these beauties ? and who replied : i have made a far more beautiful choice ! whom ?   la poverta   : whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant .    despite his misgivings about anarchist violence , tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in russia , and corrected the proofs of kropotkin s words of a rebel , illegally published in st petersburg in 1906 . tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of henry george , incorporating it approvingly into later works such as   resurrection   , the book that played a major factor in his excommunication . tolstoyans identify themselves as christians , but do not generally belong to an           simple life , preferring to be vegetarian , non-smoking , teetotal and chaste . tolstoyans are considered christian pacifists and advocate nonresistance in all circumstances . they do not support or participate in the government which they consider immoral , violent and corrupt . tolstoy rejected the state and all institutions that are derived from it - the police , law courts and army . tolstoy influenced mohandas karamchand gandhi who set up a cooperative colony called tolstoy farm near johannesburg , south africa , having been inspired by tolstoy s ideas . the colony comprising 1,100 acre was funded by the gandhian herman kallenbach and placed at the disposal of the satyagrahis from 1910 . he also inspired similar communal experiments in the united states where the residents were also influenced by the views of henry george and edward bellamy. , as well as in russia , england and the netherlands .  mid 20th century  several anarchists from the mid-20th century , including herbert read , ethel mannin , leopold kohr , and paul goodman ,           s 1944 book   bread and roses : a utopian survey and blue-print   has been described by anarchist historian robert graham as setting forth an ecological vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive industrial organization of society .  leopold kohr  leopold kohr was an economist , philosopher and political scientist known both for his opposition to the cult of bigness in social organization and as one of those who initiated the   small is beautiful   movement . for almost twenty years he was professor of economics and public administration at the university of puerto rico . he described himself as a philosophical anarchist . in 1937 , kohr became a freelance correspondent during the spanish civil war , where he was impressed by the limited , self-contained governments of the separatist states of catalonia and aragon , as well as the small spanish anarchist city states of alcoy and caspe . in his first published essay disunion now : a plea for a society           1941 , kohr wrote about a europe at war : we have ridiculed the many little states , now we are terrorized by their few successors . he called for the breakup of europe into hundreds of city states . kohr developed his ideas in a series of books , including   the breakdown of nations   ,   development without aid   and   the overdeveloped nations   . from leopold kohr s most popular work   the breakdown of nations   :  ... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery : bigness . oversimplified as this may seem , we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness , or oversize , is really much more than just a social problem . it appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation . whenever something is wrong , something is too big . ... and if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression ,           not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement . it is because human beings , so charming as individuals or in small aggregations , have been welded into overconcentrated social units .  later in his academic and writing career he protested the cult of bigness and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life . he argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation . his vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control . kohr was an important inspiration to the green , bioregional , fourth world , decentralist , and anarchist movements , kohr contributed often to john papworth s journal for the fourth world  , resurgence . one of kohr s students was economist e. f. schumacher , another prominent influence on these movements , whose best selling book   small is beautiful   took its title from one of kohr s core principles . similarly , his ideas inspired kirkpatrick sale s books   human scale   . sale arranged the first american publication of   the breakdown of nations   in 1978 and wrote the foreword .  murray bookchin  murray bookchin was an american libertarian socialist author , orator , and philosopher . in 1958 , murray bookchin defined himself as an anarchist , seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology . his first book ,   our synthetic environment ,   was published under the pseudonym lewis herber in 1962 , a few months before rachel carson s   silent spring   . the book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism . his groundbreaking essay ecology and revolutionary thought introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics . in 1968 he founded another group that published the influential   anarchos   magazine , which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy , and on decentralization and miniaturization . lecturing           of ecology to the counterculture .   post-scarcity anarchism   is a collection of essays written by murray bookchin and first published in 1971 by ramparts press . it outlines the possible form anarchism might take under conditions of post-scarcity . it is one of bookchin s major works , and its radical thesis provoked controversy for being utopian and messianic in its faith in the liberatory potential of technology . bookchin argues that post-industrial societies are also post-scarcity societies , and can thus imagine the fulfillment of the social and cultural potentialities latent in a technology of abundance . the self-administration of society is now made possible by technological advancement and , when technology is used in an ecologically sensitive manner , the revolutionary potential of society will be much changed . in 1982 , his book   the ecology of freedom   had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement , both in the united states and abroad . he was a principal figure in the burlington greens in 1986-90 , an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to           cities   , bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept . a few years later   the politics of social ecology   , written by his partner of 20 years , janet biehl , briefly summarized these ideas .  jacques ellul  jacques ellul was a french philosopher , law professor , sociologist , lay theologian , and christian anarchist . he wrote several books about christianity , the technological society , propaganda , and the interaction between religion and politics . professor of history and the sociology of institutions on the faculty of law and economic sciences at the university of bordeaux , he authored 58 books and more than a thousand articles over his lifetime in all , the dominant theme of which has been the threat to human freedom and religion created by modern technique . the ellulian concept of technique is            the technological society   . what many consider to be ellul s most important work ,   the technological society   was originally titled :   la technique : lenjeu du sicle   . in it , ellul set forth seven characteristics of modern technology that make efficiency a necessity : rationality , artificiality , automatism of technical choice , self-augmentation , monism , universalism , and autonomy . for ellul the rationality of technique enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor , the setting of production standards , etc . and it creates an artificial system which eliminates or subordinates the natural world . today , he argues , the technological society is generally held sacred . since he defines technique as the totality of methods rationally arrived at , and having absolute efficiency in every field of human activity , it is clear that his sociological analysis focuses not on the society           efficient techniques .  contemporary developments  notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include derrick jensen , jaime semprun , george draffan , john zerzan , starhawk and alan carter .  social ecology and communalism  social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of murray bookchin and influenced by anarchist peter kropotkin . social ecologists assert that the present ecological crisis has its roots in human social problems , and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human . bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called communalism . while originally conceived as a form of social anarchism , he later developed communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism , marxism , syndicalism , and radical ecology . politically , communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens  assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion . this method used to achieve this is called libertarian municipalism which involves the establishment of           with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state . janet biehl is a writer associated with social ecology , the body of ideas developed and publicized by murray bookchin . in 1986 , she attended the institute for social ecology and there , began a collaborative relationship with bookchin , working intensively with him over the next two decades in the explication of social ecology from their shared home in burlington , vermont . from 1987 to 2000 , she and bookchin co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter   green perspectives   , later renamed   left green perspectives   . she is the editor and compiler of   the murray bookchin reader   ; the author of   the

magazine           the principal voice in the uk advocating green anarchism , an explicit fusion of libertarian socialist and ecological thinking . founded after the 1984 stop the city protests , the magazine was launched in the summer of that year by an editorial collective consisting of alan albon , richard hunt and marcus christo . early issues featured a range of broadly anarchist and ecological ideas , bringing together groups and individuals as varied as class war , veteran anarchist writer colin ward , anarcho-punk band crass , as well as the peace convoy , anti-nuclear campaigners , animal rights activists and so on . however the diversity that many saw as the publication s greatest strength quickly led to irreconcilable arguments between the essentially pacifist approach of albon and christo , and the advocacy of violent confrontation with the state favoured by hunt . during the 1990s   green anarchist   came under the helm of an editorial collective that included paul rogers , steve booth and others , during which period the publication became increasingly aligned with primitivism , an anti-civilization philosophy advocated by writers such as john           1995 , hampshire police began a series of at least 56 raids , code named  operation washington  , that eventually resulted in the august to november 1997 portsmouth trial of green anarchist editors booth , saxon wood , noel molland and paul rogers , as well as animal liberation front press officer robin webb and animal liberation front supporters group newsletter editor simon russell . the defendants organised the gandalf defence campaign . three of the editors of green anarchist , noel molland , saxon wood and booth were jailed for  conspiracy to incite  . however , all three were shortly afterwards released on appeal .  fredy perlman  fredy perlman was a czech-born , naturalised american author , publisher and militant . his most popular work , the book   against his-story , against leviathan !   , details the rise of state domination with a retelling of history through the hobbesian metaphor of the leviathan . the book remains a major source of inspiration for anti-civilization           of philosopher john zerzan.  anarcho-primitivism  anarcho-primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization . according to anarcho-primitivism , the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification , coercion , and alienation . anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non- civilized ways of life through deindustrialisation , abolition of the division of labour or specialization , and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies . there are other non-anarchist forms of primitivism , and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern , civilized problems . anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through rewilding .   john zerzan   john zerzan is an american anarchist and primitivist philosopher and author . his works criticize agricultural civilization as inherently oppressive , and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of hunter gatherers as an inspiration for what a free society should look like . some subjects of his criticism include domestication , language , symbolic thought and the concept of time           refusal   ,   future primitive and other essays   ,   running on emptiness   ,   against civilization : readings and reflections   and   twilight of the machines   . zerzan was one of the editors of   green anarchy   , a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and insurrectionary anarchist thought . he is also the host of   anarchy radio   in eugene on the university of oregon s radio station kwva . he has also served as a contributing editor at   anarchy magazine   and has been published in magazines such as   adbusters   . he does extensive speaking tours around the world , and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other nonprofit organizations . in 1974 , black and red press published   unions against revolution   by spanish ultra-left theorist grandizo munis that included an essay by zerzan which previously appeared in the journal            , zerzan became intimately involved with the   fifth estate   ,   anarchy : a journal of desire armed   ,   demolition derby   and other anarchist periodicals . he began to question civilization in the early 80 s , after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour , at the time when fredy perlman was making similar conclusions .     green anarchy       green anarchy   was a magazine published by a collective located in eugene , oregon . the magazine s focus was primitivism , post-left anarchy , radical environmentalism , african american struggles , anarchist resistance , indigenous resistance , earth and animal liberation , anti-capitalism and supporting political prisoners . it had a circulation of 8,000 , partly in prisons , the prison subscribers given free copies of each issue as stated in the magazine . green anarchy was started in 2000 and in 2009 the green anarchy website shut down , leaving a final , brief message about the cessation of the           an anti-civilization journal of theory and action . author john zerzan was one of the publication s editors .     species traitor       species traitor   is a sporadically published journal of insurrectionary anarcho-primitivism . it is printed as a project of black and green network and edited by anarcho-primitivist writer , kevin tucker . st was initially labeled as a project of the coalition against civilization and the black and green network . the cac was started towards the end of 1999 in the aftermath of the massive street protests in eugene and in seattle of that year . that aftermath gave a new voice and standing for green anarchist and anarcho-primitivist writers and viewpoints within both the anarchist milieu and the culture at large . the first issue came out in winter of 2000-2001 and contained a mix of reprints and some original articles from derrick jensen and john zerzan among others . issue two came in the following year           step from the first issue in becoming something of its own rather than another mouthpiece of green anarchist rhetoric . the articles took a more in depth direction opening a more analytical and critical draw between anarchy and anthropology , attacks on reason and the progress/linear views of human history and future that stand at the base of the ideology of civilization .  vegan anarchism  veganarchism or vegan anarchism , is the political philosophy of veganism and anarchism , creating a combined praxis that is designed to be a means for social revolution . this encompasses viewing the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals , both human and non-human , whilst practising a vegan lifestyle . it is either perceived as a combined theory , or that both philosophies are essentially the same . it is further described as an anti-speciesist perspective on green anarchism , or an anarchist perspective on animal liberation . veganarchists typically view oppressive dynamics within society to be interconnected , from statism , racism and sexism to human supremacy and redefine veganism as a           . those who believe in veganarchy can be either against reform for animals or for it , although do not limit goals to changes within the law .  derrick jensen  derrick jensen is an american author and environmental activist living in crescent city , california . jensen s work is sometimes characterized as anarcho-primitivist , although he has categorically rejected that label , describing primitivist as a racist way to describe indigenous peoples . he prefers to be called indigenist or an ally to the indigenous , because indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations , and .. we need to recognize that we colonizers are all living on stolen land .   a language older than words   uses the lens of domestic violence to look at the larger violence of western culture .   the culture of make believe   begins by exploring racism and misogyny and moves to examine how this cultures economic system leads inevitably to hatred and atrocity .   strangely like war   is about deforestation .           .   welcome to the machine   is about surveillance , and more broadly about science and what he perceives to be a western obsession with control .   resistance against empire   consists of interviews with j. w. smith , kevin bales , anuradha mittal , juliet schor , ramsey clark , stephen schwartz , alfred mccoy , christian parenti , katherine albrecht , and robert mcchesney the media ) conducted between 1999 and 2004 .   endgame   is about what he describes           he asks : do you believe that this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living ? nearly everyone he talks to says no . his next question is : how would this understanding that this culture will not voluntarily stop destroying the natural world , eliminating indigenous cultures , exploiting the poor , and killing those who resist shift our strategy and tactics ? the answer ? nobody knows , because we never talk about it : were too busy pretending the culture will undergo a magical transformation .   endgame   , he says , is about that shift in strategy , and in tactics . jensen co-wrote the book   deep green resistance : strategy to save the planet   with lierre keith and aric mcbay  crimethinc.  crimethinc. is a decentralized anarchist collective of autonomous cells . crimethinc. emerged in the mid-1990s , initially as the hardcore zine   inside front   , and began operating as a collective in 1996 . it has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarchist           . individuals adopting the crimethinc.   nom de guerre   have included convicted elf arsonists , as well as hacktivists who successfully attacked the websites of dare , republican national committee and sites related to u.s. president george w. bush s 2004 re-election campaign . the creation of propaganda has been described as the collectives  core function . among their best-known publications are the books   days of war , nights of love   ,   expect resistance   ,   evasion   ,   recipes for disaster : an anarchist cookbook   and the pamphlet   fighting for our lives   , the hardcore punk/political zine   inside front   , and the music of hardcore punk bands . as well as the traditional anarchist opposition to the state and capitalism , agents have , at times , advocated a straight edge lifestyle , the total supersession of gender roles , violent insurrection against the state , and the refusal           engage in direct action , . organizing themselves through groups like earth first ! , root force , or more drastically , the earth liberation front , earth liberation army and animal liberation front . they may take direct action against what they see as systems of oppression , such as the logging industry , the meat and dairy industries , animal testing laboratories , genetic engineering facilities and , more rarely , government institutions . such actions are usually , though not always , non-violent , with groups such as the olga cell attempting assassinations of nuclear scientists , and other related groups sending letterbombs to nano tech and nuclear tech-related targets . though not necessarily green anarchists , activists have used the names animal rights militia , justice department and revolutionary cells among others , to claim responsibility for openly violent attacks .  convictions  rod coronado is an eco-anarchist and is an unofficial spokesperson for

was named new shrewsbury . at this time , the waterfall was known to be about high ; erosion and the destruction of the dam near the ironworks have led to its diminishment.  the ironworks  grovers ironworks was the central fixture of the community , and it was one of the oldest built in the country , predated only by buildings in jamestown and massachusetts . in 1675 , a half-interest in the

often accepted as the namesake of tinton falls . in 1691 , colonel morris died , leaving tinton manor and the ironworks to his nephew of the same name . by 1714 , the ironworks had become less

hebron is a administrative divisions of new yorktown  geography  hebron s beautiful hills and valleys are part of the slate valley of the upper taconic mountains , and part of the great appalachian valley . thus , many of the main hills , valleys , creeks and roads run diagonally across hebron in keeping with the general outlay of the appalachians . hebron is notably at once a nexus between valley regions within the  great valley  , and also between mountain regions . the nexus of the champlain and hudson valleys is located here . the taller peaks of the taconics are on the vermont side of the border , and begin to dwindle comparatively into foothills in hebron . hebron can be described as the foothills between the adirondack mountains of new york , and the taconic and green mountains of vermont . hebron thus is           a lowlands dividing mountain areas . in an era of much water pollution , it is a good thing to be at the top end of watersheds . hebron s battles with water quality are internal rather than related to problems upstream . according to the united states census bureau , the town has a total area of 56.4 sqmi , of which , 56.2 sqmi of it is land and 0.2 sqmi of it is water . the east town line of hebron is the vermont border , and the beginning of new england proper . the town of salem is adjacent to the south . the towns of argyle , hartford and granville make up the remaining border on western and northern edges . ny route 22 is a north-south highway through the eastern part of the town , running roughly parallel to the vermont border . route 30 connects salem to hartford through the western part of hebron . route 31 , the longest road through hebron , cuts across diagonally from route 30 connecting west hebron to           between two major watersheds whose waters travel great distances in opposite directions , only to rejoin ultimately in the atlantic ocean . the formal valleys and watersheds to which hebron belongs are the following : champlain valley / lake george watershed02010001 ; hudson river valley / hudson-hoosic watershed02020003 . waters in the northernmost part of hebron drain via the mettawee river north into lake champlain , where they mix with waters from lake george and then flow into the saint lawrence river . these hebron waters mingle in the saint lawrence with waters of all the great lakes as they flow northeast into the gulf of st. lawrence , and ultimately join the atlantic ocean . meanwhile , the majority of hebron waters drain south via black creek into the batten kill and then the hudson river , and flow south into the atlantic ocean just below new york city . the two branches of black creek join in west hebron           after the waterfall in the west branch of black creek . see map . see the approximation of the watershed divide mapped in context of mountains and valleys . see washington county for a set of contextual maps .  demographics  as of the census of 2000 , there were

ninety six is a town in greenwood county , south carolina , united states . the population was 1,998 at the 2010 census .  geography  ninety six is located at . according to the united states census bureau , the town has a total area of 1.5 square miles , all land .  etymology  there is much confusion about the mysterious name , ninety-six , and the true origin may never be known . speculation has led to a romantic indian myth ; to the mistaken belief that it was 96 miles to the nearest cherokee settlement of keowee ; to a counting of creeks crossing the main road leading from lexington , sc , to ninety-six , sc ; to an interpretation of a welsh expression , nant-sych , meaning dry gulch . however , no one is able to confirm that robert goudey was welsh , english , scottish , or german . an examination of early maps indicates markings such as 30 and 60 and 90 at different points , possibly indicating           it is possible that parish linear measurements used in england were used on colonial maps to measure distances in chains . in england , according to a british and welsh booklet designating linear measurements , parish maps used a rule of 4 chains to the inch . in using that parish rule on an early map of colonial south carolina , 90 chains on a map would probably cover approximately 24 inches , the map distance from saxe gotha to ninety-six . using the same measurements for the distance from ninety-six to the savannah river , the measurement would be approximately 2.5 inches or 6 chains , hence 96 . even so , the origin of the name , ninety-six , likely remains a mystery .  history  ninety six was established on the frontier in the early 18th century ; it was known for a time as jews land because some prominent sephardic jewish families of london bought extensive property there . the salvador and dacosta families bought 200000 acre , intending to help some poor sephardic families to relocate to the new           ninety-six district when it was established in july 1769 . since the late 20th century , the national park service operates the ninety six national historic site at the site of the original settlement and fort . ninety six figured prominently in the anglo-cherokee war . it also was a site for southern campaigns of the american revolutionary war . the first land battle of the revolution south of new england was fought here in 1775 . on august 1 , 1776 , american militia forces led by major andrew williamson were ambushed by cherokee and loyalists near here in the battle of twelve mile creek ;

yeshivish , refers to a sociolect of english spoken by yeshiva students and other jews with a strong connection to the orthodox yeshiva world .  research  only a few serious studies have been written about yeshivish . the first is a master s thesis by steven ray goldfarb called a sampling of lexical items in yeshiva english . the work lists , defines , and provides examples for nearly 250 yeshivish words and phrases . the second , more comprehensive work is   frumspeak : the first dictionary of yeshivish   by chaim weiser . weiser maintains that yeshivish is not a pidgin , creole , or an independent language , nor is it precisely a jargon . he refers to it instead , with tongue-in-cheek , as a   shprach   , a yiddish word meaning language or rapport . baumel following weiser notes that yeshivish differs from english in three ways . katz describes it in words on fire : the unfinished           of english , which is taking over as the vernacular in everyday life in some .. circles in america and elsewhere . heilman and others consider code-switching a part of yeshivish . though kaye would exclude english-speakers in the context of a yeshiva , studying the talmud , from code-switching where he considers the terms yiddish english or yiddishized english may be more appropriate .  relation to other languages   english  the english variant of yeshivish consists of grammatical irregularities borrowed from yiddish , and a vocabulary consisting of yiddish , rabbinic hebrew , talmudic aramaic , and sometimes modern hebrew . the speaker will use those terms instead of their english counterpart , either because of cultural affinity , or lack of the appropriate english term .  yiddish  the yiddish variant of yeshivish is questionable as a definition in itself , since the grammar remains identical to that of yiddish . it may be argued that the yiddish variant of yeshivish is a new phenomenon , and consists of less germanic terms and more aramaic           on the secular and cultural variants of yiddish , and may be attributed to the fact that yivo , the forerunner of yiddish as an academic study , was founded by secular jews who themselves were unlikely to be educated in yeshivas and also removed by one or more generations from yeshiva-educated speakers . however , the yeshivish dialect of yiddish has existed for quite a few centuries among yeshiva-educated jews in eastern and central europe . however , as a result of the holocaust , world war ii and immigration , the secular-speaking yiddish community is very small , and is far outnumbered by religious yiddish-speaking communities in new york , antwerp , jerusalem , bnei beraq , london and others , making the predominant contemporary yiddish dialect that of the yeshivish variant .  hebrew  the yeshivish dialect of hebrew consists of occasional ashkenazic pronunciation and various yiddishisms within modern hebrew spoken among haredi communities in israel . while many terms from the talmud and mishna exist in modern hebrew , their pronunciation is in line with modern hebrew , whereas in the yeshivish variant , they maintain           present in yeshivish hebrew , these are not distinct to the yeshivish dialect and can be found in mainstream modern hebrew as well .  patterns of usage  yeshivish is primarily a male spoken dialect . fathers and sons , particularly of teenage years and above , might speak yeshivish , while mothers and daughters generally do not , or they speak a milder variety of it . this can be explained as much of the yeshivish lexicon is learnt in yeshivot where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature . familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations . there is a higher incidence of yeshivish being spoken amongst orthodox jews that are regularly involved in torah study , or belong to a community that promotes its study . commonly used platitudes amongst orthodox jews are frequently expressed with their yeshivish equivalent . examples include substituting   shkoikh   for thank you , a contraction from the hebrew yashar koach which literally translates as may your strength be firm and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a           meaning blessed is the name of god . yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to god or hashem . neophyte orthodox jews might overcompensate in their efforts to assimilate to the community s parlance and speak a stilted artificial form of yeshivish . words might be used in an incorrect context and pronounced in an unusual manner . another tendency of baalei teshuva is to cite excessive godly references in their speech . some observers predict that the english variant of yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical judeo-hybrid languages like yiddish , ladino or judeo-arabic . the judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular , hebrew , aramaic and jewish religious idioms . as yiddish was to middle high german , yeshivish may be to standard american english . however , the integration of modern-day jews with non-jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past .  distinct features   vocabulary  the vocabulary and grammatical           native language , although it includes scholarly jargon , primarily from the talmud and acharonim in yiddish , hebrew , and aramaic . in many sentences however , the grammatical and lexical features of the speaker s native language is slight and sometimes even lacking altogether . a distinguishing feature of yeshivish is that its speakers knowingly apply highly technical and literal written language to a colloquial language and in common day usage , similar to modern hebrew , for example :  he caused a lot of   nezek   , but   lbasoif   was   moideh bmiktzas   and claimed he was   shoigeg    nezek in its original context refers to the talmudic notion of tort law , lbasoif means eventually , moideh bmiktzas refers to partial confession of a defendant , and shoigeg in its original context means an incident which was caused unwillingly , but was a result of partial negligence . despite its heavy borrowing of technical and legal terms , the above sentence would be understood clearly by speakers of           eventually admitted that he did it , although he claimed it was inadvertent . note in the above example that   shoigeg   does not have the same meaning in yeshivish as it does in its original context , wherein it implies negligence .   oines   would be the correct technical term , but it may be argued that there is less preference for   oines   in yeshivish due to its meaning in modern hebrew of rape .  phonology  the yeshivish accent has similarities to various accents of eastern european and new york backgrounds . one notable feature of yeshivish is the frequency of occurrence of the phoneme x , common in many words of hebrew , aramaic , and yiddish origin . /t/ may be released when in general american it would be flapped or unreleased . final stops may devoice and pre-nasal // may not raise .  discourse and prosody  yeshivish may use a chanting intonation for reading and discussing jewish texts . a number of other distinctive intonations are also used : for instance , a           click is used , borrowed from israeli hebrew : :   but sometimes it s more - click i do nt know how to explain it .   yeshivish has some unique interjections . for instance   oh !   and   psshhhh !   may be used as praise markers.  grammar   morphology  loan words are often given plurals using standard english morphology . for instance , the plural of   yeshiva   is   yeshivas   rather than   yeshivois   as in ashkenazi hebrew . hebrew nouns ending in   -us   are pluralized with the suffix   -in   rather than replacing   -us   with   -uyois   as in ashkenazi hebrew , e.g.   shlichus shlichusin    mission  and   mashmaus mashmausin    implication  . this likely comes from the yiddish plural marker   -n   although it could also           loan verbs may also conjugate with standard english patterns . for example , yiddish derived   daven    pray  may become   davening   or   davened   , e.g. i already davened mincha. and quiet , i m davening.  syntax and semantics  some verbs , particularly those of hebrew origin , are often treated as participles , and inflected by english auxiliary verbs , in the same way that periphrastic verbs are constructed in yiddish . for example : :   he was takeh moideh that he was wrong .   : :  he admitted that he was takeh wrong .  : :   he was   puts   moideh   to admit into the third-person singular past tense :   we ll always be soimech on rav plony s psak that the eruv is kosher .   : :  we ll always rely upon rabbi so-and-so s ruling that the eruv is usable .  : :   we ll always be           rely  into the first-person plural future tense there are a number of phrasal verbs calqued from yiddish , for instance   bring down   and   tell over    recount , retell  . modals may be used differently than in standard english , e.g.   i want that you should get her number   . there are a number of differences between the use of prepositions in yeshivish and standard english : the preposition   by   has a wide array of meanings in yeshivish : :   are you eating by rabbi fischer ?   :   by chabad , it s different .   a possible cause for this is that the

birthplace = mexico city , mexico deathplace = mexico city , mexico mario fortino alfonso moreno reyes , known more casually as simply mario moreno , and known professionally as cantinflas , was a mexican comic film actor , producer , and screenwriter . he often portrayed impoverished   campesinos   or a peasant of   pelado   origin . the character came to be associated with the national identity of mexico , and allowed cantinflas to establish a long , successful film career that included a foray into hollywood . charlie chaplin once commented that he was the best comedian alive , and moreno has been referred to as the charlie chaplin of mexico . to audiences in the united states , he is best remembered as co-starring with david niven in a golden globe award-winning role in the 1956 film   around the world in 80 days   . as a pioneer of the cinema of mexico , moreno helped usher in its golden age of the cinema of mexico           with his own , was examined by media critics , philosophers , and linguists , who saw him variably as a danger to mexican society , a bourgeois puppet , a kind philanthropist , a transgressor of gender roles , a pious roman catholic church  personal life  mario fortino alfonso moreno reyes was born in the   santa mara la redonda   neighbourhood of mexico city , and grew up in the tough neighborhood of tepito . he was one of the children born to pedro moreno esquivel , an impoverished mail carrier , and mara de la soledad reyes guzar . they had eight children : pedro , jos , eduardo , fortino , esperanza , catalina , enrique , and roberto . he made it through difficult situations with the quick wit and street smarts that he would later apply in his films . his comic personality led him to a circus tent show , and from there to legitimate theatre and film . he married valentina ivanova zubareff , of russian ethnicity , on october           death in january 1966 . a son was born to moreno in 1961 by another woman ; the child was adopted by valentina ivanova and was named mario arturo moreno ivanova , causing some references to erroneously refer to him as cantinflas  adopted son . he served as president of the mexican actor s trade union in 1993 , after his death in mexico city of lung cancer , thousands appeared on the rainy day for his funeral . the ceremony was a national event , lasting three days . his body lay in state in the   rotonda de las personas ilustres   and he was honored by many heads of state and the united states senate , which held a moment of silence for him . after his death , a 20-year legal battle ensued between mario moreno ivanova , cantinflas  son and heir to his estate , and the actor s blood nephew , eduardo moreno laparade over the control of 34 films made by cantinflas . the nephew           rights for movies on his deathbed . moreno ivanova argued he is the direct heir of cantinflas and the rights belong to him . moreno laparade won the lawsuit twice , but moreno ivanova eventually triumphed after two appeals . in 2005 , mario moreno ivanova , jr . won rights to 39 films and name . at the same time , another legal battle ensued between columbia pictures and moreno ivanova over control of these films . columbia claims that it bought the rights to the 34 films four decades ago with the court noting several discrepancies in the papers . moreno ivanova wanted the rights to the films to remain his and more generally , mexico s , as a national treasure . on june 2 , 2001 the eight-year battle was resolved with columbia retaining ownership over the 34 disputed films .  origin of name  as a young man , cantinflas performed a variety of acts in travelling tents , and it was here that he acquired the nickname cantinflas , although the origin of the name is obscured by legend . according to one obituary           parents from knowing he was in the entertainment business , which they considered a shameful occupation . in another version , the mexican media critic and theorist carlos monsivis cites a legendary account of the origin of cantinflas  characteristic speech :  entertainment career  before starting his professional life in entertainment , he explored a number of possible careers , such as medicine and professional boxing , before joining the entertainment world as a dancer . by 1930 he was involved in mexico city s   carpa   circuit , performing in succession with the ofelia , sotelo of azcapotzalco , and finally the valentina   carpa   , where he met his future wife . at first he tried to imitate al jolson by smearing his face with black paint , but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with baggy pants , a rope for a belt , and a distinctive mustache . in the tents , he danced , performed acrobatics , and performed roles related to several different professions .            and producer santiago reachi and subsequently partnered with him to form their own film production venture . reachi produced , directed , and distributed , while cantinflas acted . cantinflas made his film debut in 1936 with   no te engaes corazn   before meeting reachi , but the film received little attention . reachi established posa films in 1939 with two partners : cantinflas and fernandez . before this , reachi producedshort films that allowed him to develop the cantinflas character , but it was in 1940 that he finally became a movie star , after shooting   ah est el detalle   , with sofa lvarez , joaqun pardav , sara garca , and dolores camarillo . the phrase that gave that movie its name became a cantinflas for the remainder of his career . the film was a breakthrough in latin america and was later recognized by   somos   magazine as the 10th greatest film produced largely in mexico . in 1941 , moreno first             el gendarme desconocido   . by this time , he had sufficiently distinguished the   peladito   character from the 1920s-era   pelado   , and his character flowed comfortably from the disenfranchised , marginalized , underclassman to the empowered public servant . the rhetoric of   cantinflismo   facilitated this fluidity . he would reprise the role of agent 777 and be honored by police forces throughout latin america for his positive portrayal of law enforcement .   ni sangre , ni arena   the 1940s and 1950s were cantinflas  heyday . in 1941 , he rejected mexican film companies and instead signed with columbia pictures . by this time , his popularity was such that he was able to lend his prestige to the cause of mexican labor , representing the national association of actors in talks with president of           his theatrical work   yo coln   in the   teatro de los insurgentes   , the same theatre that had earlier been embroiled in a controversy over a diego rivera mural incorporating cantinflas and the virgin of guadalupe . critics , including the pan and archbishop luis mara martnez , called the mural blasphemous , and it was eventually painted without the image of the virgin .   yo coln   placed cantinflas in the character of christopher columbus , who , while continually discovering america , made comical historical and contemporary observations from fresh perspectives . the jokes changed nightly , and moreno continued to employ his word games and double entendres to jab at politicians . in 1956 ,   around the world in eighty days   , cantinflas  american debut , earned him a golden globe for best actor in a musical or comedy . variety magazine said in 1956 that his chaplinesque quality made a big contribution to the success of the film . the film ultimately made an unadjusted $42 million           dollars ) . while david niven was billed as the lead in english-speaking nations , cantinflas was billed as the lead elsewhere . as a result of the film , cantinflas became the world s best paid actor . moreno s second hollywood feature ,   pepe   , attempted to replicate the success of his first . the film had cameo appearances by frank sinatra , judy garland and other stars . his humor , deeply rooted in the spanish language , did not translate well for the american audience and the movie was a notorious box office disappointment . he still earned a golden globe nomination for his part . later in a 1992 american interview , moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the united states . after returning to mexico , cantinflas starred in the comic drama   el bolero de raquel   , the first cantinflas film to be distributed to the united states by columbia pictures . the film was followed by three more **27;27972;toolong productions :   el           padrecito   , and   su excelencia   . after   su excelencia   , cantinflas began to appear in a series of low-budget comedies , which were produced by his own company cantinflas films . these films lasted until   el barrendero   , in 1982 . like charlie chaplin , cantinflas was a social satirist . he played   el pelado   , an impoverished everyman , with hopes to succeed . with mutual admiration , cantinflas was influenced by chaplin s earlier films and ideology .   el circo   was a shadow of chaplin s silent film ,   the circus   and   si yo fuera diputado   had many similarities with the 1940 film ,   the great dictator   . cantinflas  films , to this day , still generate revenue for columbia pictures . in 2000 , columbia reported in an            cultural impact  among the things that endeared him to his public was his comic use of language in his films ; his characters would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it to the point where no one understood what they were talking about . the cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money , was courting an attractive young woman , or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities , whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell . this manner of talking became known as   cantinflada   , and it became common parlance for spanish speakers to say   ests cantinfleando !   whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation . the real academia espaola officially included the verb ,   cantinflear   ,   cantinflas           dictionary in 1992 . in the visual arts , mexican artists such as rufino tamayo and diego rivera painted cantinflas as a symbol of the mexican everyman . the american electronic dance music band mindless self indulgence released a song about cantinflas called whipstickagostop . cantinflas  style and the content of his films have led scholars to conclude that he influenced the many   teatros   that spread the message of the chicano movement during the 1960s-1970s in the united states , the most important of which was el teatro campesino . the   teatro   movement was an important part of the cultural renaissance that was the social counterpart of the political movement for the civil rights of mexican americans . cantinflas  use of social themes and style is seen as a precursor to chicano theater . a cartoon series , the   cantinflas show   , was made in 1972 starring an animated cantinflas . the show was targeted for children and was intended to be educational . the first animated version animated by santiago moro and his brother jose luis           show ) which educated children by meeting such notable people such as chopin , louis pasteur , albert einstein and william shakespeare s romeo and juliet as well learning how important water and oil is and educational parodies of some of his famous movies like   su excelencia   la carta with incidental music from aaron copeland s el salon mexico in the second version his character was known as   little amigo   and concentrated on a wide range of subjects intended to educate children , from the origin of soccer to the reasons behind the international date line . the second animated series animated in 1979 and dubbed in english in 1982 was a joint venture between televisa and hanna-barbera and mario morenos voiced little amigo /cantinflas in the spanish version and don messick voiced little amigo and john stephenson as the narrator in the english version . both the cantinflas show and amigos and friends aired in the mid 1990 s on univision and televisa re aired the cantinflas show in the mid 1990 s . although cantinflas never achieved the same success in           with a star in the hollywood walk of fame . he earned two golden globe nominations for best actor and the mexican academy of film lifetime achievement award . his handprints have been imbedded onto the paseo de las luminarias for his work in motion pictures . the mario moreno cantinflas award is handed out annually for entertainers who represent the latino community with the same humor and distinction as the legendary mario moreno cantinflas and who , like cantinflas , utilizes his power to help those most in need . cantinflas films are distributed in north america by  characterisations  moreno s life is the subject of the biographical film   cantinflas   . it stars scar jaenada , who portrays a young mario moreno attempting to gain respect and make a living as an actor , and award winning actor michael imperioli as mike todd , an american film-producer struggling to film his masterpiece . the film is centered in moreno s personal life , and in the development of todd s golden           .  references in pop culture  in the season 9 episode of the animated sitcom   king of the hill   , death buys a timeshare , hank s father cotton is lured into buying a timeshare that includes access to an exclusive yacht whose private chef once worked for cantinflas . in the episode , cotton pronounces cantinflas , . the mindless self indulgence song whipstickagostop has the lyrics cantinflas was a body rocker in it .  critical response  cantinflas is sometimes seen as a mexican groucho marx character , one who uses his skill with words to puncture the pretensions of the wealthy and powerful , the police and the government . historian and author of   cantinflas and the chaos of mexican modernity   , writes , cantinflas symbolized the underdog who triumphed through trickery over more powerful opponents and presents cantinflas as a self-image of a transitional mexico . gregorio luke , executive director of the museum of latin american art said , to understand cantinflas is to understand what happened in mexico during the last century . monsivis interprets           spoken word in the context of mexico s reigning illiteracy . particularly in the film   el analfabeto   , , cantinflas is the illiterate who takes control of the language by whatever means he can . the journalist salvador novo interprets the role of moreno s character entirely in terms of   cantinflismo   :   en condensarlos : en entregar a la saludable carcajada del pueblo la esencia demaggica de su vacuo confusionismo , estriba el mrito y se asegura la gloria de este hijo cazurro de la ciudad ladina y burlona de mxico , que es  cantinflas . in his biography of the comic , scholar of mexican culture jeffrey m. pilcher views cantinflas as a           that was just out of reach for the majority of mexicans : his nonsense language eloquently expressed the contradictions of modernity as  the palpitating moment of everything that wants to be that which it can not be  . likewise , social hierarchies , speech patterns , ethnic identities , and masculine forms of behavior all crumbled before his chaotic humor , to be reformulated in revolutionary new ways .  filmography   awards and nominations

appointed to the court by president ronald reagan in 1986 , scalia has been described as the intellectual anchor for the originalist and textualist position in the court s conservative wing . scalia was born in trenton , new jersey , and attended public grade school and catholic high school in new york city , where his family had moved . he attended georgetown university as an undergraduate and obtained his bachelor of laws degree from harvard law school . after spending six years in a cleveland law firm , he became a law school professor . in the early 1970s , he served in the nixon and ford administrations , first at minor administrative agencies , and then           the carter years teaching at the university of chicago , where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling federalist society . in 1982 , he was appointed as a judge of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit by president ronald reagan . in 1986 , scalia was appointed by reagan to the supreme court to fill the associate justice seat vacated when justice william rehnquist was elevated to chief justice . whereas rehnquist s confirmation was contentious , scalia was asked few difficult questions by the senate judiciary committee , and faced no opposition . scalia was unanimously confirmed by the senate , becoming the first italian-american justice . scalia has served on the court for nearly thirty years , during which time he has established a solidly conservative voting record and ideology , advocating textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation . he is a strong defender of the powers of the executive branch , believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas . he opposes affirmative action and other policies that treat minorities as groups .           and , in his minority opinions , often castigates the court s majority in scathing language .  early life and education  an only child , scalia was born in trenton , new jersey , on march 11 , 1936 . he became a professor of law at the university of virginia in 1967 , moving his family to charlottesville , virginia . after four years in charlottesville , in 1971 , scalia entered public service . president richard nixon appointed him as the general counsel for the office of telecommunications policy , where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television . from 1972 to 1974 , he was the chairman of the administrative conference of the united states , a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy . in mid-1974 , nixon nominated him as united states assistant attorney general in the aftermath of watergate scandal following ford s defeat by president jimmy carter , scalia worked for several months at the american enterprise institute . he then returned to academia , taking up           to 1982 , though he spent one year as a visiting professor at stanford law school . in 1981 , he became the first faculty adviser for the university of chicago s chapter of the newly founded federalist society .  judge and nominee  when ronald reagan was elected president in november 1980 , scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration . he was interviewed for the position of solicitor general of the united states , but the position went to rex e. lee , to scalia s great disappointment . scalia was offered a seat on the chicago-based united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in early 1982 , but declined it , hoping to be appointed to the highly influential united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . later that year , reagan offered scalia a seat on the d.c. circuit , which scalia accepted . he was confirmed by the united states senate on august 5 , 1982 , and was sworn in on august 17 , 1982 . on the d.c. circuit ,           legal circles for powerful , witty legal writing , which was often critical of the supreme court precedents he felt bound as a lower-court judge to follow . scalia s opinions drew the attention of reagan administration officials , who , according to   the new york times   , liked virtually everything they saw and .. listed him as a leading supreme court prospect . scalia has taken a broad view of the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution  individual rights   abortion  scalia has argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion , and that if the people desire legalized abortion , a law should be passed to accomplish it . scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of   planned parenthood v. casey   ,  the states may , if they wish , permit abortion on demand , but the constitution does not require them to do so . the permissibility of abortion , and the limitations upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying           found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment . the court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted , which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house because of indoor growing lights . uncomfortable with the changes brought about following vatican ii , scalia regularly attends the tridentine latin mass in both chicago and washington , and has driven long distances to parishes that he felt were more in accord with his beliefs . in a 2013 interview with jennifer senior for   new york   magazine , scalia was asked if his beliefs extended to the devil , scalia stated , of course ! yeah , he s a real person . hey , cm on , that s standard catholic doctrine ! every catholic believes that . when asked if he had seen recent evidence of the devil , scalia replied , you know , it is curious . in the gospels , the devil is doing all sorts of things . he           people and whatnot what he s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in god . he s much more successful that way . senior , jennifer .   new york   magazine , october 14 , 2013 , p. 26 . in another 2013 interview , scalia stated that in order for capitalism to work , in order for it to produce a good and stable society , traditional christian virtues are essential . in 2006 , scalia , approached by a reporter upon leaving church , was asked if being a traditional catholic had caused problems for him . he responded by asking , you know what i say to those people ? , and with a gesture , cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out . the gesture , which was captured by a photographer , was initially reported by the   boston herald   as obscene . scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of   the sopranos           brush-off . roger axtell , an expert on body language , described the gesture as possibly meaning i ve had enough , go away and noted , it s a fairly strong gesture .  assessment  in 2009 , after nearly a quarter century on the court , scalia characterized his victories as damn few . his biographer , joan biskupic , speculated that scalia , health permitting , might remain on the court for another decade . writing in   the forward   , j.j. goldberg described scalia as the intellectual anchor of the court s conservative majority . citation whereas he is widely admired among conservatives , many liberals dislike his views . in march 2009 , openly gay congressman barney frank described him as a homophobe . citation rossum , writing in 2006 , before george w. bush appointees john roberts his dislike of legislative history may be a reason why other justices have become more cautious in its use . gregory maggs wrote in the   public interest law review   in 1995 that by the early 1990s , legislative           supreme court cases involving the interpretation of statutes , and no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome . maggs suggested ,  with justice scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the congressional record or senate reports , the other members of the court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs . it is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically . no one likes an unnecessary fight , especially not one with as formidable an opponent as justice scalia.

a gambit is a chess opening in which a player , more often white , sacrifices material , usually a pawn , with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position . some well-known examples are the king s gambit , queen s gambit , and evans gambit . a gambit used by black may also be called a gambit , but is sometimes called a countergambit . the word gambit was originally applied to chess openings in 1561 by spain  strategy  class= toccolours style= margin : 0 0 1em 1em ; border:none ; font-size : 95% ; clear           e f g h a b c d e f g h gambits are often said to be  offered  to an opponent , and that offer is then said to be either  accepted  or  declined .  if a player who is offered a gambit captures the piece the gambit is said to be accepted . if the player who was offered the gambit ignores it and instead continues his or her development , then the gambit is said to be declined . in modern chess , the typical response to a moderately sound gambit is to accept the material and give the material back at an advantageous time . for gambits that are less sound , the accepting player is more likely to try to hold onto his extra material . a rule of thumb often found in various primers on chess suggests that a player should get three moves of development for a sacrificed pawn , but it is unclear how useful this general maxim is since the free moves part of the compensation           . of course , a player is not obliged to accept a gambit . often , a gambit can be declined without disadvantage .  soundness  a gambit is said to be  sound  if it is capable of procuring some concession from the opponent . there are three general criteria in which a gambit is often said to be sound : *time gain : the player accepting the gambit must take time to procure the sacrificed material and possibly must use more time to reorganize his pieces after the material is taken . *generation of differential activity : often a player accepting a gambit will decentralize his pieces or pawns and his poorly placed pieces will allow the gambiteer to place his own pieces and pawns on squares that might otherwise have been inaccessible . in addition , bishops and rooks can become more active simply because the loss of pawns often gives rise to open file *generation of positional weaknesses : finally , accepting a gambit may lead to a compromised pawn structure , holes or other positional deficiencies . a good example of           e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3. d4 exd4 4 . bc4 . here black can force white to sacrifice a pawn speculatively with 4 ... bb4+ , but white gets very good compensation for one pawn after 5. c3 dxc3 6. bxc3 , or for two pawns after 6.0-0 inviting 6 ... cxb2 7 . bxb2 , due to the development advantage and attacking chances against the black king . as a result , black is often advised not to try to hold onto the extra pawn . a more dubious gambit is the so-called halloween gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . nc3 nf6 4 . nxe5 ? ! nxe5 5. d4 . here the investment is too large for the moderate advantage of having a strong center .  examples  *king s gambit : 1. e4 e5 2. f4 *queen s gambit : 1. d4 d5 2. c4 *evans gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bc4 bc5 4. b4 *rousseau gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 .           intending 2. .. cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4 . nxc3 *two knights defence : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bc4 nf6 4 . ng5 d5 with 5. exd5 na5 6 . bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 likely to follow . *blackmardiemer gambit : 1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3 . nc3 followed by 4. f3 *from s gambit : 1. f4 e5 *staunton gambit : 1. d4 f5 2. e4 *budapest gambit : 1. d4 nf6 2. c4 e5 *scotch gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3. d4 exd4 4 . bc4 *latvian gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 f5 *blackburne shilling gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bc4 nd4 ? ! : this is not a true gambit by black , since after 4 . nxe5 ! ? qg5 ! black wins material . white can play a gambit himself with 5 . bxf7+ ! ke7 6.0-0 ! qxe5 7 . bxg8 rxg8 8. c3 nc6 9. d4 , when white s two pawns and           , give white strong compensation for the sacrificed bishop . *elephant gambit : 1. e4 e5 2 . nf3 d5 ! ? *englund gambit : 1. d4 e5 ? ! *italian gambit : 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bc4 bc5 4. d4 *fried liver attack : 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bc4 nf6 4 . ng5 d5 5. exd5 nxd5 6 . nxf7 kxf7 *albin countergambit : 1 . d4 d5 2. c4 e5 *benko gambit : 1 . d4 nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5  notes   further reading  *
the river mole is a tributary of the river thames in southern england . it rises in west sussex near horsham and flows north west through surrey for 80km mi to the thames at east molesey , opposite hampton court palace . the river gives its name to the surrey district of mole valley . the mole crosses the north downs between dorking and leatherhead , where it cuts a steep-sided valley , known as the mole gap , through the chalk . much of the catchment area lies on impermeable rock , meaning that the river level responds rapidly to heavy rainfall . during the second half of the 20th century pollution levels in the river were high , however since 1995 the water quality has improved dramatically and the mole now boasts the greatest diversity of fish species of any river in england . twelve sites of special scientific interest that include wetland habitats are located within the mole catchment area and the stretch of river through leatherhead has been designated a local nature reserve           of conservation and is an sssi of european importance . the river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets , particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between dorking and leatherhead . in john speed s 1611 map of surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend the river runneth under . however the river s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour : the   oxford dictionary of english place names   suggests that   mole   either comes from the latin   mola   or is a back-formation from   molesey   . domesday book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086 , of which sidlow mill was the oldest , dating from saxon times .  catchment area  the drainage area of the river mole is 512 km and forms 5% of the river thames catchment area above teddington . annually the catchment           average level of rainfall is 800 mm rain around crawley . the mole catchment reaches a maximum elevation of 265m ft above ordnance datum at leith hill to the south west of dorking . there is only one aquifer in the drainage basin , at fetcham , which means that the majority of the water in the river is from surface drainage , particularly from gatwick airport and the urban areas of horley and crawley , and that the flow rate responds rapidly to rainfall .  course   upper mole  river mole rises in baldhorns copse 0.7kmmi 1 to the south of the village of rusper in west sussex . the river flows initially southwards for 1kmmi 1 to a small lake at baldhorns park , before running eastwards through a largely rural area towards crawley . the first tributaries to join the young river drain the northernmost part of st leonard s forest , between horsham and crawley , although much of the forest is in the catchment area of the river arun . the mole skirts the northern suburbs of crawley where it is joined by           ifield mill pond . the first gauging station on the mole is south of gatwick airport . **16;3929;ref the gauging station south of gatwick airport was installed in 2005 , replacing an earlier station located 200 m downstream . the mean flow is 0.33m3/s cuft/s and the river ran dry at this point for the first time in the summer of 1995 . the mole runs under the airport runway in a culvert completed in 1985 . the course of the mole within the airport perimeter has been altered several times since commercial flights began in 1945 ; however the meanders visible on the 1839 tithe map in the 1.5 km stretch immediately north of the runway were reinstated in 1999 , in a 1.2 million project to facilitate airport expansion . the mole enters surrey to the south of horley , where it meets the gatwick stream , a tributary draining worth forest to the southeast of crawley . the second-largest sewage treatment works in the mole catchment is located on the gatwick stream 3km mi upstream           15 megalitres of water per day , and in prolonged dry periods it accounts for up to 75% of the flow of the mole downstream of the confluence . the mean flow measured at horley gauging station is 1.40m3/s cuft/s . the mole passes horley to the west , flowing north towards sidlow and entering a largely rural area . 0.7kmmi 1 south of sidlow the mean flow is measured as 2.21m3/s cuft/s at kinnersley manor gauging station . the earlswood brook , a tributary draining the urban area of reigate and redhill , joins the mole at sidlow . the largest stw in the mole catchment discharges up to 118.5 megalitres per day into the earlswood brook . **16;3947;ref a principal tributary of the earlswood brook is the redhill brook , which includes the moors wetland nature reserve within its catchment area . from sidlow the mole turns north west towards brockham . a number of minor tributaries join the river from the west and are typically           horsham and dorking . the 18th century weir at betchworth was modified in 2004 to facilitate the installation of two 27.5 kw low-head hydro turbines . about 90% of the energy generated is fed into the regional electricity grid , while the remainder is used to supply the betchworth park estate , where the weir is situated . the river leaves the wealden clay at brockham , passing betchworth castle and flowing briefly across greensand and gault clay to pixham , 1kmmi 1 north east of dorking . a mean flow of 3.74m3/s cuft/s is measured at a fourth gauging station , located at castle mill . at pixham the mole meets the pipp brook , a tributary draining the northeastern slopes of leith hill . **16;3965;ref the pipp brook drains the northernmost heavily wooded slopes of leith hill , as well as areas of wotton , westcott and dorking .  mole gap  between dorking and leatherhead the mole cuts a steep-sided valley though the north downs           western flank of box hill and a smaller 50 m cliff at ham bank in norbury park . the sudden change from impermeable wealden clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river stretch between brockham and leatherhead , compared to 3 m in 12 mi between horley and brockham ) allow the water table to drop below the bed of the river . water is able to flow out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks , decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel . the course of the river through norbury park was partially straightened when the epsom to horsham railway was built in 1837 , with the removal of a small meander north of westhumble . the meander was reinstated in 1997 , in an attempt to enhance this area of the park , although it has since become blocked by silt . the entirety of the mole gap lies within the surrey hills area of outstanding natural beauty .  lower mole  at leatherhead           flow across impermeable london clay , winding towards cobham . the water table rises at this point and much of the water which drained out of the channel through the chalk returns through springs in the riverbed . the aquifer at fetcham is the only one in the entire catchment area . the next major tributary , the rye , joins to the north of leatherhead , before the river is crossed by the m25 motorway . at cobham the river swings round in a pronounced axe-head meander skirting painshill landscape garden , where a 35 ft diameter waterwheel raises water 5 m from the river to feed the ornamental lake in the park . **16;3983;ref the undershot wheel at painshill park was restored in 1987 and is located at the end of an artificial leat , rather than on the main river channel . from painshill park the river flows northeastwards to the thames , passing to the west of esher commons and then forming the boundary between hersham and esher , where the mean flow of the river is 5.43m3/s cuft/s . in response           september 1968 , the river was modified downstream of albany bridge to the thames and new flood defences were constructed . finally the mole splits into two branches at the island barn reservoir near molesey : the northern branch continues as the river mole and the southern branch is known as the river ember . the two rivers flow either side of the reservoir , before running side by side in a north easterly direction , merging 400 m before the confluence with the river thames , on the reach above teddington lock . prior to the last ice age , the river thames followed a more northerly route to the north sea , from reading via marlow , chorleywood , st albans , hertford and along the present suffolk-essex border . during this period , the mole is thought to have merged with the river wey near byfleet and then flowed in a north-easterly direction via richmond to meet the           and wey are less than 2km mi apart at their closest point near painshill park ) . during the middle pleistocene period , **16;4001;ref the middle pleistocene period was ca. 781,000-126,000 years ago a large ice sheet built up across much of the east of england , reaching as far south as st albans and chelmsford , blocking the path of the proto-thames . glacial meltwater from the anglian ice sheet , caused the thames to divert southwards and flood the valley of the mole-wey river , thus adopting its present route through london .  ecology   water quality  the water quality of the watercourses in the river mole catchment area has improved dramatically since the 1990s . in 1990 the environment agency assessed only 23% of the watercourses as grade b or better , but by 2002 60% had reached this standard . investment in the sewage treatment works within the catchment area has improved the quality of the discharges into the river and modifications to the runway and apron drainage systems at gatwick airport means that surface water is diverted to aerated pollution           released into the river . there have been a number of high profile pollution incidents of the river in recent years : in 2003 , gatwick airport ltd pleaded guilty to charges of allowing chemical pollution to enter the river mole after a detergent , used to clean rubber and oil from the runway , was washed into crawters brook by airport workers . the environment agency estimated that up to 5200 fish of 14 different species were killed as the pollution spread downstream . the airport was fined 30,000 by lewes crown court . in may 2003 , sewage leaking from a pump operated by thames water leaked into the stanford brook killing a number of coarse fish in the gatwick stream .  biodiversity  the marsh frog   pelophylax ridibundus   is now commonly found in the upper mole and its tributaries around newdigate and gatwick . there is no evidence that the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians . a second non-native species , the edible frog are commonly found where the river runs over the london clay . crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around brockham and the tributaries which run over the wealden clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies , caddisflies , fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles . the beautiful demoiselle disappeared from the river           but has since recolonised . the white-legged damselfly is also found along the river and the downy emerald is found between box hill and leatherhead . the mole is one of only three locations in england where the river shingle beetle   meotica anglica   is found . a nationally scarce species which is locally common on the river mole is the greater dodder   cuscuta europaea   .  conservation  the mole catchment area includes twelve sites of special scientific interest which include wetland habitats and the stretch of river through leatherhead has been designated a local nature reserve . the mole gap forms part of a special area of conservation and is an sssi of european importance . the stretch of river between thorncroft manor and river lane in fetcham has been designated a local nature reserve . although much of the surrounding land has been taken by residential and commercial development , this section of the mole           15 species of dragonfly . the geology of the local area is complex , since the river leaves the chalk of the mole gap at this point and flows over gravel and clay , creating a patchwork of different habitats including scrub , woodland , hedges , banks , and meadows as well as the water itself . the river also provides a corridor for wildlife through the centre of leatherhead . the west end common forms part of the esher commons , owned and managed by elmbridge borough council . the river mole forms the western boundary of the common , flowing past a steep sandy area known locally as   the ledges   . plant species typical of ancient woodland are found in this area , including bluebells , marsh marigolds and golden saxifrages . large bittercress and the non-native himalayan balsam are also found along           on the west bank of the mole , west of the island barn reservoir . the heath is an area of rough scrubland and , despite its name , is a reclaimed landfill site hence its large but artificial mound and small plateau . the site is a rich habitat for birds including the redshank and little ringed plover.  angling  below is a list of the coarse fish records for the river mole l barbel - 15 lb 6oz l roach - 2 lb 5oz l chub - 6 lb 12oz l pike - 25 lb

20% is on tunbridge wells sand and 20% is on greensand . brickearth deposits are common in the valley around betchworth and east of dorking . the upper mole catchment is dominated by a single broad terrace , which runs continuously from the entry to the           meath green , the terrace corresponds to the flood plain of the river , however from this point downstream to brockham , the river cuts a narrow trench no more than 150m wide . a similar trench is runs up several of the mole s tributaries , notably along deanoak brook which follows a local strike . the presence of the trench protects the land from flooding rendering it suitable for agriculture .  mole gap **27;4048;span  between dorking and leatherhead the mole cuts a steep-sided valley through the north downs , creating a 170 m high river cliff on the western flank of box hill . the bedrock is permeable chalk and the water table lies permanently below the level of the riverbed , allowing water to drain out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks . the amount of water lost from the river is significant and in very hot summers the channel can become dry between mickleham and thorncroft manor ; this was recorded most recently in 1949 and 1976 . at leatherhead , the           . at this point that the water table rises enough for the water to flow back into the main river channel . in a survey in 1958 , the geologist c.c. fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between dorking and mickleham ; most were only a few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line . most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or heavy flow and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed . a few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre . about six of these larger swallow holes were found to the west of the burford bridge hotel , along the course of the a24 mickleham bypass during its construction in 1936 . initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding . however this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes , up to 18 m in diameter , each fully supported           access shaft to allow periodic inspection . in the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by under the centre of one of the domes . when the dorking to leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859 , a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of box hill and westhumble railway station , suggesting that even in its early history , the river had swallow holes . the author daniel defoe , who attended school in dorking and probably grew up in the village of westhumble , described the swallow holes in the river mole in his book   a tour thro  the whole island of great britain   :  . the current of the river being much obstructed by the interposition of those hills , called box hill .. it forces the waters as it were to find their way through as well as they can ; and in order to do this , beginning , i say , where the           box-hill , called the stomacher , the waters sink insensibly away , and in some places are to be seen little channels which go out on the sides of the river , where the water in a stream not so big as would fill a pipe of a quarter of an inch diameter , trills away out of the river , and sinks insensibly into the ground . in this manner it goes away , lessening the stream for above a mile , near two , and these they call the swallows .  not all of the water removed from the river by the swallow holes is returned to the channel at leatherhead . the chalk aquifer also feeds the springs at the southern end of fetcham mill pond , which have never been known to run dry . a survey in march 1883 estimated that the fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 million gallons of water every day . a second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons           day . the water table in the chalk of the wey gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone . it has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the mole gap .  lower mole **27;4077;span  at leatherhead the river leaves the chalk bedrock , moving onto london clay . the river meanders across an alluvial plain between 400 and 800 m wide towards cobham , where it begins to descend to a lower flood plain which in turn broadens to the axehead meander at painshill park . at the east end of painshill park , the lower flood plain abruptly narrows to form a narrow trench about 60 m wide , in which the river runs northwards for 6.5km mi towards hersham , where the river enters the flood plain of the river thames . there are a series of gravel deposits laid down by the river above the london clay between cobham , walton-on-thames and esher . the depth of the deposits generally varies from 2.5mft sigfig=1 to 7mft sigfig=1 , and the lower           iron oxide , whilst the upper layers are loosely packed with angular flints and sand . remains of a further gravel terrace containing both cherts and flints to a depth of 4mft sigfig=2 are located along the side of st george s hill .  history   etymology  the river is first recorded in the   red book of thorney   in ad 983 as   emen   and in the ad 1005   cartulary of the abbey of eynsham   as both   emen   and   men   . variations in the name are recorded throughout the middle ages and the river appears as   amele   in domesday book and subsequently as   emele   in 12th and 13th century court rolls . this name is probably derived from the old english word   men   meaning   misty   or   causing mists   , and the name of the river ember probably has its origins in this name . **16;4106;ref the prefix of the           referred to as emley bridge in some 19th century records , probably also has its origins in the old english word   men   . the name   mole   does not appear until the 16th century , first occurring as   moule   in harrison s   description of britain   of 1577 . the antiquarian william camden uses the latinized form   molis   in the 1586 edition of   britannia   and michael drayton is the first to use   mole   in his poem   poly-olbion   published in 1613 . in john speed s 1611 map of surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend the river runneth under . however the river s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour : the   oxford dictionary of english place names   suggests that   mole   either comes from the latin   mola   or is a back-formation from           . in john rocque s 1768 map of surrey , the name   moulsey river   is used .  archaeology  in common with much of the rest of the weald , the earliest evidence of human settlement along the upper mole is from the mesolithic period . mesolithic sites at wonham , flanchford and sidlow . finds at wonham include arrowheads and a plano-convex knife . the lower mole appears to have been settled during the same period and a flint axe dating from mesolithic period found on spit of land close to river mole in cobham in 1965 . remains of a flat-bottomed dug-out canoe were found at the confluence of the mole and thames in 1877 by a local boatman . the canoe is preserved at the pitt rivers museum in oxford . the mole gap and north downs do not appear to have been settled until the late stone age : a large axe , typical of a rough-out axe produced during the neolithic period , which was discovered in 1952 during building work in westhumble ,           at east horsley along with neolithic flakes of flint at fetcham and headley heath . significant bronze age finds include a bronze sword found close to the river north of amberley farm near charlwood and a small hoard of weaponry consisting of two palstave axes and a scabbard chape was discovered in 2003 in norbury park close to ham bank .  navigation  it is not clear to what extent the mole was used for navigation in the past : in the late 13th century , thorncroft manor purchased a   shout   , a type of boat up to 16 m in length used to carry produce to market and it has been suggested that stone cut from quarries in reigate was transported to london via the river . during the 17th century , two bills came before parliament to make sections of the river navigable . the first , in 1663 , was passed by the house of commons but was defeated in the house of lords . during the following year , an act was passed by           from reigate to the river thames , but was never executed . the only surrey river to have been made fully navigable is the river wey . in 1798 william marshall advocated the canalisation of a short stretch of the river mole between betchworth and dorking to facilitate the movement of chalk from quarry to market . in 1810 the engineer john rennie proposed a canal linking the river medway to portsmouth which was to have a branch to london following the mole for much of its length . between 1825 and 1828 the architect and civil engineer nicholas wilcox cundy proposed a grand imperial ship canal from deptford to chichester passing through the mole gap , however he was unable to attract sufficient financial interest in his scheme . today the mole is navigable for the 400 m from the confluence with the river thames to molember weir at east molesey where there is a private mooring facility . the river may be paddled all year by canoe between brockham and fetcham with an appropriate licence from the british canoe union .  world war ii defences  during the           mole were fortified for the defence of london against invasion from the south . ghq line b ran along the north downs from farnham and guildford , crossing the mole gap to the north of dorking and following the river to horley . between betchworth and box hill , the north bank of the river mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing . at boxhill farm , where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows , a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure . gun mounts were also installed to protect both boxhill and deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were installed . an anti-tank ditch was dug from the stepping stones eastwards across the fields belonging to bradley farm . the river crossing at sidlow bridge was heavily defended and a line of pill boxes was constructed on the north bank of the river . concrete anti-tank dragon s teeth were built on both sides of the river , a short distance upstream of the bridge ,           the mole   mole gap  the north downs way crosses the river at box hill via seventeen hexagonal stepping stones , which are frequently submerged after heavy rainfall . the current stones were dedicated in september 1946 by the then prime minister clement attlee , replacing those destroyed during ww2 as an anti-invasion measure . the location is popular both with anglers and families , although swimming is strongly discouraged as the water is polluted in places . the stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of westhumble . when the burford bridge was rebuilt in 1937 , excavations revealed a flint-surfaced approach to a ford at low level having all the signs of roman workmanship suggesting that stane street crossed the river at this point . in defoe s time , there was a footbridge at this point , but carts and waggons had to cross the river by a ford .  leatherhead  there are three listed bridges in leatherhead of which the 14 arch leatherhead town bridge is the oldest .           the late middle ages and was rebuilt and enlarged by the county surveyor george gwilt in 1782-83 . the bridge is a long structure of 14 segmental arches resting on low piers , finished in red brick in flemish bond , with some portland stone dressing . a few metres downstream of leatherhead bridge stands the grade ii listed railway viaduct which carries the leatherhead to dorking line over the river . the bridge was constructed in 1867 and , at the insistence of thomas grissell the landowner , was given lavish architectural treatment . the single span shell bridge stands in the grounds of thorncroft manor , to the south of the town centre . the bridge was constructed as an ornamental feature in parkland laid out by capability brown in the late 18th century . the bridge is largely composed of flint and has a large inverted scallop shell in the place of the keystone and similar shells in the spandrels at each side . the bridge was renovated and strengthened in 1999 by a group of canadian engineers working on the terra nove project . the restoration project           who were billeted in the manor during the second world war .  cobham  a wooden bridge is thought to have existed on the site of cobham bridge since the twelfth century , the upkeep of which was the responsibility of the adjacent landowners . the present bridge was constructed by george gwilt in 1792 , after responsibility for maintenance had been transferred to the county council by act of parliament . the bridge has nine low arches and is primarily built of red brick with stone coping . the parapets were rebuilt in 1914 and the structure was given a grade ii listing in 1953.  watermills  domesday book listed twenty mills on the river mole in 1086.  upper mole  horley mill was first mentioned in a deed of the early thirteenth century . the most recent mill was demolished in 1959 , although the mill house still stands . the first mill at sidlow was built during saxon times . the final mill on the site was demolished in 1790 , however remains of the mill leat are still visible . mention is made of           mill race are still visible .  lower mole  slyfield mill near stoke dabernon is first mentioned in domesday book . it was used for fulling woollen cloth and milling corn . five of the mills mentioned in domesday book were in the borough of elmbridge . downside mill , cobham was the mill of the manor of downe . until the dissolution of the monasteries it was owned by chertsey abbey . it has been used for many purposes including the processing of corn , paper , iron , tinplate and flock and the generation of electricity . the present building dates from the 18th century but it is inaccessible to the public . cobham mill , downstream of leatherhead , consisted of two mills used for grinding corn . in 1953 the larger mill was demolished by surrey county council to allieviate traffic congestion on mill road . the remaining red brick mill dates from the 1822 and was in use until 1928 . it was restored to full working order by the cobham mill preservation trust , and is now open to the public from 2 pm           . esher mill was at the end of lower green road where there is now an industrial estate . it was used to process corn , brass wire , iron , paper , linoleum , and books . for many years there may have been two mills on the site for corn grinding and industrial use . there were a series of fires over a century and after the last in 1978 the buildings were demolished . east molesey upper mill was associated with the manor of molesey matham . it was used to produce gunpowder from the time of the commonwealth until about 1780 . the island where it stood now forms part of the ornamental gardens of a housing development called the wilderness . east molesey lower mill , also known as sterte mill , was associated with the manor of molesey prior . during the commonwealth it was used for gunpowder manufacture , but after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 it reverted to corn milling . an old timber structure was replaced by a brick building in the 1820s which           hampton court way . in addition there was ember mill , which stood on the banks of the old course of the river ember near hampton court way .  river ember flood relief channel and confluence with the thames  the river mole originally flowed into the river thames at the point where the present hampton court bridge now crosses the thames . however , during the early 1930s , when hampton court way and the bridge were built , the river mole was redirected to flow into the river ember and both rivers now enter the thames in a single widened and straightened channel once occupied only by the river ember . there have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968.  literature  the river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets , particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between dorking and leatherhead edmund spenser wrote of the river :  : and mole , that like a nousling mole doth make : his way still under ground till thamis he overtake .  in   poly-olbion   the poet michael drayton described the journey taken by the river thames to the sea :  : as still his goodly traine yet every houre increast , : and from the   surrian   shores cleer   wey   came down to meet : his greatnes , whom the   tames   so gratiously doth greet : that with the fearne-crown d flood he minion-like doth play : : yet is not this the brook , entiseth him to stay . : but as they thus , in pompe , came sporting on the shole , : gainst   hampton-court   he meets the soft and gentle   mole   . : whose eyes so pierct his breast , that seeming to foreslowe : the           : with trifling up and down , he wandreth here and there ; : and that he in her sight , transparent might appeare , : applyes himselfe to fords , and setteth his delight , : on that which might make him gratious in her sight . : but   tames   would hardly on : oft turning back to show , : for his much loved   mole   how loth he was to go . : the mother of the   mole   , old   holmsdale   , likewise beares : thaffection of her childe , as ill as they do theirs : : but   mole   respects her words , as vaine and idle dreames , : compar d with that high joy , to be belov d of   tames :   : and head-long holds her course , his company to win . :   mole   digs her selfe a path , by working day and night : described the river as  : sullen mole that runneth underneath  in a similar vein , alexander pope wrote in his poem   windsor forest    : and sullen mole that hides his diving flood  robert bloomfield writes the following lines about the mole valley in his 1806 poem   wild flowers   .  :           thy balm that softens human ills ; : come on the long drawn clouds that fling : their shadows oer the surry-hills . : yon green-topt hills , and far away : where late as now i freedom stole , : and spent one dear delicious day : on thy wild banks romantic mole . : ay there s the scene ! beyond the sweep : of london s congregated cloud , : the dark-brow d wood , the headlong steep , : and valley paths without a crowd ! : here thames i watch thy flowing tides , : thy thousand sails am proud to see ; : but where the mole all silent glides : dwells peace - and peace is wealth to me .  extract from   the river mole or emlyn stream   by mary uniacke , which was published in 1839 .  : who may count back that forgotten time : when first the waters forced an outlet here : : when the foundations of these stedfast hills : were shaken , and           ? that awful day : yet leaves its trace . the waters find their way , : now laughing in the sun - now swallowed up : in caverns pervious to their course alone , : they leave their channel dry , and hide awhile : their silent flow ; like bitter tears , unshed : from the dim eye , before a careless world : unheeding of our grief ; but swelling still : in the full heart , which leaves unsoothed , unseen , : and broods oer ruined hopes , and days gone by .   tributaries  the major tributaries of the river mole are the ifield

  the beggar s opera   is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by john gay with music arranged by johann christoph pepusch . it is one of the watershed plays in augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today . ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera , but without recitative . the lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadsheet ballads , opera arias , church hymns and folk tunes of the time .   the beggar s opera   premiered at the lincoln s inn fields theatre on 29 january 1728 and ran for 62 consecutive performances , the longest run in theatre history up to that time . the work became gay s greatest success and has been played ever since . in 1920 ,   the beggar s opera   began an astonishing revival run of 1,463 performances at           one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time . the piece satirised italian opera , which had become popular in london . according to   the new york times   : gay wrote the work more as an anti-opera than an opera , one of its attractions to its 18th-century london public being its lampooning of the italian opera style and the english public s fascination with it . instead of the grand music and themes of opera , the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people . some of the songs were by opera composers like handel , but only the most popular of these were used . the audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters . the story satirised politics , poverty and injustice , focusing on the theme of corruption at all levels of society . lavinia fenton , the first polly peachum , became an overnight success . her pictures were in great demand , verses were written to her and books published about her . after appearing in            the beggars opera   , she ran away with her married lover , charles powlett , 3rd duke of bolton . bertolt brecht and kurt weill adapted the opera into   die dreigroschenoper   in 1928 , sticking close to the original plot and characters but with a new libretto and mostly new music .  origin and analysis  the original idea of the opera came from jonathan swift , who wrote to alexander pope on 30 august 1716 asking ... what think you , of a newgate pastoral among the thieves and whores there ? their friend , gay , decided that it would be a satire rather than a pastoral opera . for his original production in 1728 , gay intended all the songs to be sung without any accompaniment , adding to the shocking and gritty atmosphere of his conception . however , a week or so before the opening night , john rich , the theatre director , insisted on having johann christoph pepusch , a composer associated with his theatre , write           songs in the opera , including a fugue based on lucy s 3rd act song i m like a skiff on the ocean toss d ) and also to arrange the 69 songs . although there is no external evidence of who the arranger was , inspection of the original 1729 score , formally published by dover books , demonstrates that pepusch was the arranger . the work took satiric aim at the passionate interest of the upper classes in italian opera , and simultaneously set out to lampoon the notable british whig party gay used scottish folk melodies mostly taken from the poet allan ramsay s hugely popular collection   the gentle shepherd   plus two french tunes , to serve his hilariously pointed and irreverent texts . the renowned composer , john christopher pepusch , composed an ouverture and arranged all the tunes shortly before the opening night at lincoln s inn fields on 28 january 1728 . however , all that remains           instrumentation ) and the melodies of the songs with unfigured basses . various reconstructions have been attempted , and a 1990 reconstruction of the score by american composer jonathan dobin has been used in a number of modern productions . gay uses the operatic norm of three acts , and tightly controls the dialogue and plot so that there are surprises in each of the forty-five fast-paced scenes and 69 short songs . the success of the opera was accompanied by a public desire for keepsakes and mementos , ranging from images of polly on fans and clothing , playing cards and fire-screens , broadsides featuring all the characters , and the rapidly published musical score of the opera . the play is sometimes seen to be a reactionary call for libertarian values in response to the growing power of the conservative whig party . it may also have been influenced by the then-popular ideology of locke that men should be allowed their natural liberties ; these democratic strains of thought influenced the populist movements           s opera   was a part . the character of macheath has been considered by critics as both a hero and an anti-hero . harold gene moss , arguing that macheath is a noble character , has written , one whose drives are toward love and the vital passions , macheath becomes an almost christ-like victim of the decadence surrounding him . contrarily , john richardson in the peer-reviewed journal   eighteenth-century life   has argued that macheath is powerful as a literary figure precisely because he stands against any interpretation , against expectation and illusion .   the beggar s opera   has had an influence on all later british stage comedies , especially on nineteenth century british comic opera and the modern musical .  adaptations  as was typical practice of the time in london , a commemorative score of the entire opera was assembled and published quickly . as was common , this consisted of the fully arranged overture followed by the melodies of the 69 songs , supported by only the simplest bass accompaniments . there are no indications of dance           in three instances : lucy s is then his fate decree d sir one measure of descending scale marked viol . ; trape s in the days of my youth , in which the fa la la chorus is written as viol. ; and the final reprieve dance , macheath s thus i stand like a turk , which includes two sections of 16 measures of dance marked viol . . the absence of the original performing parts has allowed producers and arrangers free rein . the tradition of personalised arrangements , dating back at least as far as thomas arne s later 18th century arrangements , continues today , running the gamut of musical styles from romantic to baroque : austin , britten , sargent , bonynge , dobin and other conductors have each imbued the songs with a personal stamp , highlighting different aspects of characterisation . following is a list of some of the most highly regarded 20th-century arrangements and settings of the opera . * in 1920 , the baritone frederic austin newly arranged the music           the long-running production at the lyric theatre , hammersmith . the irish baritone frederick ranalow sang the role of captain macheath in every performance . in 1955 this version was recorded by conductor sir malcolm sargent with john cameron as macheath and monica sinclair as lucy . * in 1928 , on the 200th anniversary of the original production , bertolt brecht and kurt weill created a popular new musical adaptation of the work in germany entitled   die dreigroschenoper   . in this work , the original plot is followed fairly closely but the music is almost all new . * in 1946 , john la touche and duke ellington created another musical adaptation of the work for broadway entitled   beggar s holiday   . an updated rendition of the story focused on a corrupt world inhabited by rakish mobsters , raffish madams and their dissolute           , benjamin britten created an adaptation with new harmonisations and arrangements of pre-existing tunes . additional dialogue was written by the producer , tyrone guthrie . peter pears was the first singer of macheath. * the opera was made into a film version in 1953 , and starred laurence olivier as captain macheath. * in 1975 , czech playwright vclav havel created a non-musical adaptation . * in 1977 , the nigerian nobel prize-winning playwright and dramatist wole soyinka wrote , produced and directed   opera wonyosi   , an adaptation of both john gay s   the beggar s opera   and bertolt brecht s   the threepenny opera   ; most of his characters as well as some of the arias are from the two earlier plays . * in 1981 richard bonynge and douglas gamley arranged a new edition for the australian opera . it was recorded the same year with joan sutherland , kiri te kanawa , james morris and angela lansbury. * the opera was adapted           by jonathan miller and starred roger daltrey in the role of macheath , stratford johns as peachum , gary tibbs as filch , and bob hoskins as the beggar . the happy ending was changed so that macheath is hanged instead of being reprieved. * in 1984 in the play   a chorus of disapproval   by alan ayckbourn , an amateur production of   the beggar s opera   is a major plot driver and excerpts are performed . * in 1986 in the brazilian musical film   pera do malandro   , by ruy guerra and chico buarque . * in 1990 created his period-styled performing edition for the and it has since been performed at a venues throughout the united states . this edition is based on the 1728 printed edition and includes the full overture as detailed by pepusch and fleshes out all of the remaining 69 airs and dances           was   david dunn bauer   , music director ,   n. thomas pedersen   , and choreographer ,   alan tjaarda jones   . * in 1998 , the all female japanese troupe , takarazuka revue , produced an adaptation titled   speakeasy   . the play was maya miki s retirement play . * in 2008 the sydney theatre company of australia and out of joint theatre company co-produced a version entitled   the convict s opera   written by stephen jeffreys and directed by max stafford-clark . this version is set aboard a convict ship bound for new south wales , where convicts are putting on a version of   the beggar s opera   . the lives of the convicts partly mirror their characters in   the beggars  opera   , and modern popular songs are performed throughout the piece .   the convict s opera   began touring the uk in early 2009. * vanishing point created a modern production of the beggar s opera in 2009 for the           in a near-future apocalypse world . it features music from a band called quinn . * the original opera was performed in an 18th-century setting at the open air theatre , regent s park in summer 2011 , in a production directed by lucy bailey . * currently , in 2014 , kneehigh theatre will be performing an adaptation entitled  dead dog in a suitcase  . this version uses an original score , with a wide array of musical styles .  roles  style= border-collapse : collapse jailor drawer constables  synopsis  peachum ,

week a dramatick entertainment has been exhibited at the theatre in lincolns-inn-fields , entitled the beggar s opera , which has met with a general applause , insomuch that the waggs say it has made rich very gay , and probably will make gay very rich . we hear that the british opera , commonly called the beggar s opera , continues to be acted , at the theatre in lincolns-inn fields with general applause , to the great mortification of the performers and admirers           february 1728 ) two weeks after opening night , an article appeared in   the craftsman   , the leading opposition newspaper , ostensibly protesting at gay s work as libellous and ironically assisting him in satirising the walpole establishment by taking the government s side : : it will , i know , be said , by these libertine stage-players , that the satire is general ; and that it discovers a consciousness of guilt for any particular man to apply it to himself . but they seem to forget that there are such things as innuendo s nay the very title of this piece and the principal character , which is that of a highwayman , sufficiently discover the mischievous design of it ; since by this character every body will understand one , who makes it his business arbitrarily to levy and collect money on the people for his own use , and of which he always dreads to give an account is not this squinting with a vengeance , and wounding persons in authority through the sides           s last remark : that the lower people have their vices in a degree as well as the rich , and are punished for them , implying that rich people are not so punished . criticism of gay s opera continued long after its publication . in 1776 , john hawkins wrote in his history of music that due to the opera s popularity , rapine and violence have been gradually increasing solely because the rising generation of young men desired to imitate the character macheath . hawkins blamed gay for tempting these men with the charms of idleness and criminal pleasure , which hawkins saw macheath as representing and glorifying.  sequel  in 1729 , gay wrote a sequel ,   polly   , set in the west indies : macheath , sentenced to transportation , has escaped and become a pirate , while mrs trapes has set up in white-slaving and shanghais polly to sell her to the wealthy planter mr ducat . polly escapes dressed as a boy , and after many adventures marries the son of a carib chief . the political satire ,             than in   the beggar s opera   , with the result that prime minister robert walpole leaned on the lord chamberlain to have it banned , and it was not performed until fifty years later .

initially in saint-denis , subsequently maisons-alfort and finally villeneuve-saint-georges . at twelve he went           nine months where he discovered the zulu nation and became fascinated with the rapping styles of afrika bambaataa . upon his return he passed the baccalaurat . it has been said that his constant support from his mother was one of the reasons that he was able to pass the baccalaurat and still create music . he coined the stage name mc solaar in his teens from his graffiti tags soar and solaar . he studied languages at the jussieu university campus and was a post-graduate in philosophy . he released his first single in 1990 . mc solaar went to paris in the summer of 1991 with his friend jimmy jay in hopes of succeeding in the music industry . success came quickly when his first single ,   bouge de l   , based on a sample from cymande s song   the message   became a hit in early 1990s . this song was all about brushing people to the side and not having time for them ; this is evident in the lyrics           ) :  i went straight over to lucie s she loves dogs , cats and 30 millions damis she says  do you like animals , my super mc ?  i said  yeah , i love them , well cooked and salted  she said  get out my way  .  30 millions damis is a french charity for the protection of animals , with its own eponymous tv show . the lyric may refer to either . many rappers who came out of africa at the time spoke a lot about slavery and other topics in order to bring the history of their people into light . nevertheless , the song went platinum in france and ascended to number five on the national charts .  19911997 : early success and   prose combat   breakthrough  after the success of   bouge de l   , solaar went on to support the famous american rap group de la soul when they performed at the olympia in paris in september 1991 . at the close of 1991 solaar released             went on to sell over 400,000 copies in france . with the success of his dbut album in france , the french rapper embarked upon extensive tours of poland and russia . in december 1992 he performed in twelve countries in west africa , where his french rap style proved extremely popular with african music fans . mc solaar returned to the studio in 1994 , recording the album   prose combat   . it sold 100,000 copies in the first week of its release and became a bestseller in 20 other countries . he was rewarded for his efforts when in february 1995 he received an award for best male singer of the year at the 10th edition of the french victoires de la musique awards . also in 1994 , mc solaar appeared on the red hot organization s compilation album ,   stolen moments : red hot + cool   . the album , meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the aids epidemic in relation to the african american community , was heralded as album of the year by             in 1997 with longtime friend and producer jimmy jay to record his third album ,   paradisiaque   . the album was another success , which led to an extensive european tour starting on 9 january 1998 at the znith in paris . his talents led to international interest from places such as germany in europe and all the way to japan and the united states not long after . he was even included as a guest on american rapper guru s jazzmatazz project and one of his songs was included in the tommy boy rap compilation in the states . early on in mc solaar s career it was important for him to share the struggles and the different hardships for black people that migrated to france and tried to make a living . most of his music was dedicated to enlightening the population of a specific deeper message that connected to him in his life . ... he addresses the conditions under which black people have migrated to and settled in france . in the piece  leve-toi et rap ,  he describes his chadian parents           main stages of his teenage years and how he finally came to discover rap . in an interview mc solaar described the feeling of making a song and the thought process while just writing any part of lyrics that go into his music . i write quickly , because of the music , he tells me . its much easier if you have the music , the rhythm , but i am fast . first , i have taken in everything . do you never write before the music ? ah . i used to , he admits . but when i met the music , i changed .  19972003 :   cinquime as   and   mach 6    solaar s career continued to evolve throughout the late nineties and into the new millennium . he released   cinquime as   in 2001 to critical acclaim and   mach 6   in 2003 . in the album s third track , lve-toi et rap , solaar describes his parents  chadian emigration as well as his own roots growing up           song he says :   puis trip en egypte , ecole franaise du caire/ pour parfaire mon flow et mon vocabulaire/ l jai appris lhumilit , la peur des cartouches/ pur style de sniper camouflage paw-mouche   , which , translated , roughly means he spent time at a french school in cairo , perfecting his rapping style and learning how to survive a dangerous lifestyle . critic dan gennoe attests to solaar s flow et vocabulaire by noting the flow of his words is staggering , as are the low-slung grooves that they roll to ; deftly vaulting all language barriers . the cover of   cinquieme as   depicts solaar topless , and draws comparisons to captives about to be taken onto a slave ship . however , a look at the inside cover reveals solaar to be in a wrestler s costume , along with the other men in the picture . as veronique helenon discusses in her article concerning the french hip hop scene , references to africa and blackness are a very important part of solaar s music . solaar recognizes and           boxing and wrestling references . senegalese boxer battling siki is referenced in the album s booklet . although siki won the light heavyweight boxing championship in 1922 , he still faced racism from journalists . this image combined with songs concerning colonial oppression and the migration experience from africa to france show solaar s blackness , something that is extremely important in france s hip hop scene . for example , in his song  les colonies  , solaar discusses the similarities between the oppression of africans by colonialists to the modern day exploitation of third world countries . cinquime as includes lyrics in french , english , and spanish , which represents his ideals that rap should be inclusive of all people .  2004present :   chapitre 7   and international acclaim  da vinci claude , the first single from solaar s album   chapitre 7   , was launched in march 2007 . the album was released 18 june 2007 . in early 2004 , his 2001 song la belle et le bad boy was featured on the final episode of the            . the mtv series the hills featured the song as well . mc solaar is best known outside of france for his work on guru s   jazzmatazz   project and as a guest rapper on the missy elliott track all n my grill . collaboration with elliot propelled him to higher popularity in the american market . the single le bien , le mal has been a hip hop/dance crossover hit and has received playtime on mtv , which characterizes his work this way : his fluid phrasing makes up for his lack of english , and the production on his solo work surpasses that of most of his hip-hop contemporaries . mc solaar is one of the few french rappers having success in the english-dominated american hip hop culture . mc solaar has released a few songs which never appeared on albums , including comme dans un film and inchallah . he has criticized people for illegal downloading and             and   chapitre 7   .  personal life  on 7 december 2003 , mc solaar married chlo bensemoun and on 7 may 2004 she gave birth to the couple s first child , roman . in 2007 , she gave birth to a girl named bonnie .  discography   albums  ;

spirituals are religious songs that were created by enslaved african people in the united states .  terminology and origin  the term   spiritual   is derived from   spiritual song .   the king james bible s translation of ephesians 5:19 says : speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the lord . the term spiritual song was often used in the black and white christian community through the 19th century , and spiritual was used as a noun to mean , according to the context , spiritual person or spiritual thing , but not specifically with regard to song .   negro spiritual   first appears in print in the 1860s , where slaves are described as using   spirituals   for religious songs sung sitting or standing in place , and   spiritual shouts   for more dance-like music . musicologist george pullen jackson extended the term           folk hymnody , as in his 1938 book   white spirituals in the southern uplands   , but this does not appear to have been widespread usage previously . the term , however , has often been broadened to include subsequent arrangements into more standard european-american hymnodic styles , and to include post-emancipation songs with stylistic similarities to the original negro spirituals . although numerous rhythmical and sonic elements of negro spirituals can be traced to african sources , negro spirituals are a musical form that is indigenous and specific to the religious experience in the united states of africans and their descendants . they are a result of the interaction of music and religion from africa with music and religion of european origin . further , this interaction occurred only in the united states . africans who converted to christianity in other parts of the world , even in the caribbean and latin america , did not evolve this form . there is also a duality in the lyrics of spirituals . they communicated many christian ideals while also communicating the hardship that was a result of being           to the composer s life . it was a way of sharing religious , emotional , and physical experience through song .  alternative interpretations  some scholarship claims that songs such as wade in the water contained explicit instructions to fugitive slaves on how to avoid capture , and on which routes to take to successfully make their way to freedom . wade in the water allegedly recommends leaving dry land and taking to the water as a strategy to throw pursuing bloodhounds off one s trail . the gospel train , song of the free , and swing low , sweet chariot are likewise supposed to contain veiled references to the underground railroad , and many sources assert that follow the drinking gourd contained a coded map to the underground railroad . the authenticity of such claims has been challenged as speculative , and critics like james kelley have pointed to the apparent lack of primary source material in support of them .  noted african american literary critic sterling allen brown , who had interviewed former slaves and their children , was firm in his assertion in a           some scholars who have found parallels between the words of negro and white spirituals would have us believe that when the negro sang of freedom , he meant only what the whites meant , namely freedom from sin . free , individualistic whites on the make in a prospering civilization , nursing the american dream , could well have felt their only bondage to be that of sin , and freedom to be religious salvation . but with the drudgery , the hardships , the auction-block , the slave-mart , the shackles , and the lash so literally present in the negro s experience , it is hard to imagine why for the negro they would remain figurative . the scholars certainly do not make it clear , but rather take refuge in such dicta as : the slave did not contemplate his low condition . are we to believe that the slave singing i been rebuked , i been scorned ; done had a hard time sho s you bawn , referred to his being outside of the true religion ? ex-slaves , of course , inform us differently .           sin but from physical bondage . those attacking slavery as such had to be as rare as anti-hitler marching songs in occupied france . but there were oblique references . frederick douglass has told us of the double-talk of the spirituals : canaan , for instance , stood for canada ; and over and beyond hidden satire the songs also were grapevines for communications . harriet tubman , herself called the moses of her people , has told us that go down moses was tabu in the slave states , but the people sang it nonetheless .   collections   jubilee singers of fisk university  in the 1850s , reverend alexander reid , superintendent of the spencer academy in the old choctaw nation , hired some enslaved africans from the choctaws for some work around the school . he heard two of them , uncle wallace and aunt minerva willis , singing religious songs that they had apparently composed . among these were swing low , sweet chariot , steal away to jesus , the angels are           jordan , roll . later , reid , who left indian territory at the beginning of the civil war , attended a musical program put on by a group of negro singers from fisk university . they were singing mostly popular music of the day , and reid thought the songs he remembered from his time in the choctaw nation would be at least as appropriate . he and his wife transcribed the songs of the willises as they remembered them and sent them to fisk university . the jubilee singers put on their first performance singing the old captives  songs at a religious conference in 1871 . the songs were first published in 1872 in a book entitled   jubilee songs as sung by the jubilee singers of fisk university   , by theodore f. seward . wallace willis died in 1883 or 1884 . over time , the pieces the jubilee singers performed came to be arranged and performed by trained musicians . in 1873 , mark twain , whose father had owned slaves , found fisk singing to be in the genuine old way he           in the   peoria journal   said : they have lost the wild rhythms , the barbaric melody , the passion .. they smack of the north .. some fifty years later , zora neale hurston in her 1938 book   the sanctified church   criticized fisk singers , and similar groups at tuskegee and hampton , as using a glee club style that was full of musicians  tricks not to be found in the original negro spirituals , urging readers to visit an unfashionable negro church to experience real negro spirituals.  other collections  a second important early collection of lyrics is   slave songs of the united states   by william francis allen , charles pickard ware , and lucy mckim garrison . a group of lyrics to negro spirituals was published by colonel thomas wentworth higginson , who commanded a regiment of former slaves during the civil war , in an article in   the atlantic monthly   and subsequently included in his 1869 memoir   army life in a black regiment             century saw a resurgence of the spiritual . this trend was impacted strongly by composers and musical directors such as moses hogan and brazeal dennard.

sugar ray leonard and thomas hearns are considered to be two of the best boxers of all-time . they fought twice , once in 1981 and once in 1989 . both fights are considered to be classics .  leonard-hearns i the showdown  sugar ray leonard won the wbc welterweight title with a fifteenth-round knockout of wilfred bentez in 1979 . he lost it to roberto durn by a close decision in june 1980 and regained it five months later in the infamous no ms fight , in which duran quit in the eighth round . in june 1981 , leonard moved up to the light-middleweight division for one fight , knocking out ayub kalule in nine rounds to win the wba light-middleweight title . hearns won the wba welterweight title in 1980 , scoring a second-round knockout of jose  pipino  cuevas in detroit , michigan . he made three successful title defenses , stopping luis primera , randy shields , and pablo baez . promoted as the showdown , leonard fought hearns           , nevada to unify the world welterweight championship in a scheduled fifteen-rounder . they fought before a live crowd of 23,618 and a worldwide tv audience of some 300 million . the fight began as expected , leonard boxing from a distance and hearns stalking . leonard had difficulty with hearns  long reach and sharp jab . by the end of round five , leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye , and hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards . leonard , becoming more aggressive , hurt hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin . leonard battered hearns in rounds six and seven , but hearns miraculously regrouped . hearns started to stick and move , and he started to pile up points again . the roles reversed : leonard became the stalker and hearns became the boxer . hearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards . between rounds twelve and thirteen , leonard s trainer , the legendary angelo dundee , said the now legendary words you re blowing it , son ! you re blowing it           came out roaring for the thirteenth round . after hurting hearns with a right , leonard exploded with a combination of punches and sent hearns through the ropes . hearns managed to rise , but was dropped again near the end of the round . in round fourteen , after staggering hearns with an overhand right , leonard pinned hearns against the ropes , where he unleashed another furious combination , prompting referee davey pearl to stop the contest and award sugar ray leonard the unified world welterweight championship . hearns was leading by scores of 124-122 , 125-122 , and 125-121 . after the fight , there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven . even though leonard dominated , hurting hearns and battering him , all three judges gave both rounds to leonard by a 10-9 margin . many felt that the ten-point must scoring system was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10-8. s-aft after=ko3 bruce finch  leonard-hearns ii the war  following the showdown , leonard defended the undisputed world welterweight championship once , knocking out bruce finch           surgery to repair a detached retina in his left eye . hearns moved up in weight and outpointed wilfred benitez to win the wbc light-middleweight title in 1982 . two and a half years later , he challenged marvin hagler for the undisputed world middleweight championship , losing by a knockout in the third round of a very exciting fight . in early 1987 , he stopped dennis andries in ten rounds to win the wbc light-heavyweight title . leonard made a one-fight comeback in 1984 and stopped kevin howard in nine rounds . however , leonard suffered the first knockdown of his career and was so disappointed in his performance that he once again retired after the fight . in 1987 , leonard came back again and fought hagler for the middleweight championship . leonard , a huge underdog , defeated hagler by a twelve-round split decision . the following month , leonard retired again . hearns knocked out juan roldan in four rounds in late 1987 to win the vacant wbc middleweight title , becoming the first boxer to win world titles in four weight divisions . hearns lost           knockout against iran barkley . hearns returned to win the inaugural wbo super-middleweight title against james kinchen by a majority decision on 4 november 1988 to become the first boxer to win world titles in five weight divisions . three days later , leonard knocked out don lalonde in nine rounds to win both lalonde s wbc light-heavyweight title and the vacant wbc super-middleweight title . after almost eight years , the leonard-hearns rematch finally happened . it was promoted as the war . leonard and hearns met on june 12 , 1989 at caesar s palace in a scheduled twelve-rounder for the wbc &amp; wbo super-middleweight titles . hearns dropped leonard with a right cross in the third round , but leonard came back and battered hearns around the ring in the fifth round . early in the seventh round , hearns hurt leonard but punched himself out going for the knockout . with hearns fatigued , leonard came back and had a strong finish to the round . rounds nine and ten were good rounds for leonard           . three booming rights from hearns sent leonard down for the second time in the fight . knowing he needed a big finish , leonard fought furiously and had a big final round . the judges scored the fight a draw , with both boxers retaining their respective titles . judge jerry roth scored the fight 113-112 for hearns , judge tom kazmarek scored it 113-112 for leonard , and judge dalby shirley scored it 112-112 . shirley was the only judge to give leonard a 10-8 margin in the twelfth . if he had scored it 10-9 , as his two colleagues did , hearns would have won by a split decision . the decision was soundly booed , as most felt that hearns had won . eventually , leonard admitted that hearns deserved the decision . there was talk of a third fight , but it never happened . leonard had his attorney , mike trainer , pursue a third fight , but hearns said that he could no longer make the weight and was returning to light-heavyweight. s-aft after=w12 roberto durn  notes 
deathplace = affligem abbey , brabant adeliza of louvain , sometimes known in england as adelicia of louvain , also called adela and aleidis ; was queen of england from 1121 to 1135 , as the second wife of king henry i. she was the daughter of godfrey i , count of louvain.  early life and family  adeliza of louvain was born in 1105 in louvain , present-day belgium . she was renowned for her beauty , reflected in the epithet the fair maiden of brabant . the chronicler henry of huntingdon also mentions adelizas beauty in an interlude in his historia anglorum stating , a jewel grows pale on you , a crown does not shine . put adornment aside , for nature provides your adornment ... her father was godfrey i , count of louvain , landgrave of brabant , and duke of lower lotharingia , an ally of henry v , holy roman emperor . after the death of adelizas mother , ida of chiny , godfrey married clementia of           flanders who had fought with the french against the normans in 1118 . adeliza s brother , joscelin of louvain , married the heiress to the percy fortune . he is often referred to as an opportunist. .  queenship  plans for adelizas marriage to henry i of england , may have begun when she was as young as sixteen , even before henrys only legitimate son , william adelin , died on 25 november 1120 in the white ship disaster . however , henrys need for a new male heir expedited the marriage plans and the couple wed on 24 january 1121 . apparently in addition to her beauty , henry was also attracted to adeliza as a wife because she was a descendant of charlemagne . it is thought that henrys only surviving legitimate child empress matilda , from his first wife matilda of scotland , may have been involved in arranging his second marriage , due to the fact that she was with him near the time that it was being negotiated . henry of huntingdon mentions the royal couple in his historia anglorum stating that the           appears to have traveled extensively with henry , likely to increase the chances of her conception . despite their close contact , however , adeliza and henry never produced a child . unlike henrys first wife matilda , adeliza appears to have played a very passive role in the administration of the kingdom . while matilda issued some thirty-one charters and writs during her queenship , during adeliza s fifteen-year marriage to henry i she issued one , and she only attested 13 of henrys many charters , even though they were almost always together .  role as artistic patron  despite her limited involvement in politics , adeliza seems to have played an active role as a patron of the arts and literature , and was influential in fostering the rise of french poetry in the english court . while english queens had been traditionally associated with artistic patronage for decades , and a number of them , including edith of wessex , emma of normandy and matilda , had financed a number of works in different media , adeliza primarily sponsored books written in french . at the           extremely popular , a trend given impetus by wealthy aristocratic women like adeliza . philippe de thaon , an anglo-norman poet , dedicated his zoological treatise known as the bestiary to the queen :    philippe de thaon has distilled into a french treatise     the bestiary , a book in latin ,     for the honour of a jewel who is an outstandingly beautiful woman .     and she is courtly and wise , of good customs and generous :     she is called aaliz , queen is she crowned ,     she is the queen of england ; may her soul never know trouble !     listen to what we nd about her name in hebrew :    aaliz is her name ; praise of god is     in hebrew truly aaliz , laus of god .     i do not dare give further praise , lest envy take me ,     but so that she may           i wish to compose this book ; may god be present at its beginning !    the bestiary would have been amply illustrated , and was intended to be read page by page , not all at once , like a poem . many other works that adeliza commissioned were similar in structure to the bestiary , including the now lost life of king henry by david .  widowhood and remarriage  when henry died on 1 december 1135 , adeliza retired temporarily to the benedictine convent of wilton abbey , near salisbury . she was present at the dedication of henry s tomb at reading abbey on the first anniversary of his death . at about that time , she founded a leper hospital dedicated to saint giles at fugglestone st peter , wiltshire . in 1138 , three years after henry i s death , adeliza married william daubigny , 1st earl of arundel , one of henry i s advisors , and son of guillaume daubigny and maud le bigod . together , they lived at her castle of arundel on the sussex coast           order of birth ) , alice , william , olivia , reynor , geoffrey , henry , and agatha .  relationship with matilda  although not a great deal is known about adelizas relationship with her stepdaughter , it is known she was present at the ceremony when henry officially named matilda as his heir , since the chronicler john of worcester states that the queen swore an oath for the kings daughter . after her second marriage , adeliza received matilda at her home in arundel , along with matildas half-brother robert , 1st earl of gloucester , in defiance of the wishes of her husband who was a staunch supporter of king stephen . she later betrayed them and handed them over when king stephen besieged the castle . trying to explain adeliza s actions , john of worcester suggests that she feared the kings majesty and worried that she might lose the great estate she held throughout england . he also mentions adelizas excuse to king stephen , she swore on oath that his enemies had not come to england on her account but that she had           close to her.  landholdings  because of henry is generosity , adeliza was given the revenues of rutland , shropshire and a large district of london , with possession of the city of chichester . henry also gave the manor of aston to adeliza as his queen and wife . landholdings that were part of adeliza of louvains dower include waltham in essex , an estate in south-east england , with areas in hertfordshire and bedfordshire , buckinghamshire , berkshire , and middlesex . she had property in devon . as a gift from henry i , she was given a property in ashleworth , a component of the royal estate of berkeley . in 1126 the whole county of shropshire was given to her , even though it is not listed in the pipe roll . adeliza gave her brother joscelin a large estate in sussex called petworth that was dependent on her castle of arundel . henry also gave adeliza lands that had previously been matildas including waltham and queenhithe . she had estates in essex , hertfordshire , bedfordshire , middlesex , gloucestershire , and devon .           lands . in additions to those gifts , she was given a portion of the royal estate at berkeley , and the county of shropshire . after matilda died , adeliza continued to exercise jurisdiction over her lands , retaining some of her property until 1150 . in 1136 , she endowed reading abbey with one hundred shillings a year from the revenues of queenhithe . on the first anniversary of henry is death , adeliza give the manor of aston to the abbey of reading , and endowed them with lands to provide for the convent and other religious pweaona sic coming to the abbey on the occasion of the anniversary of my lord king henry . she added the gift of a church a few years later .  later years  in the last years of her life , adeliza appears to have faded into obscurity . in 1150 , adeliza left william to enter the monastery of afflighem in flanders . at least one of her brothers was also living at this monastery . the annals at the monastery are the only source to mention her death           some traditions imply she was buried at the monastery , but a donation made by her brother joscelin to reading abbey seems to suggest she was buried there with henry i.  notes

little london is a village situated between the north hampshire downs and the gravel plains of the kennet valley , north of basingstoke and south of reading . it is situated within pamber civil parish and backs on to pamber forest , a 500acre km2 sssi and remnant of the much larger ancient royal forest of pamber . it is recorded as having been established for at least 400 years .  history  until the mid 19th century the village was a local centre for brick-making , the local clays being recognised as particularly good since the roman period . examples of clay roof tiles produced in this area for the nearby roman town of calleva atrebatum can be seen at reading museum . a major part of the village was confiscated from the engelfield family and given to the benyon family during the late tudor period . other parts were gifted in payment to the queen s college , oxford . it is assumed that this was in return for education , although it may not have been . this legacy           and houses in the area . the village has grown organically from a few houses , being effectively one street with no social centre . current local planning policy has successfully prevented any inappropriate development of additional housing in the area . current population is of only a few hundred . it is a desirable location , resulting in upper quartile house prices typical of rural hampshire . the village has one pub , the plough , which maintains a very traditional  english pub  environment .  little london  is a common village name in england , assumed by some to have its origins in the quantity of seasonal londoners who would camp for the harvest season . however in common with many  little londons  approximately 50 mi or so from london , it has also been claimed that the name was given by settlers escaping the great plague of london of 1665 . alternatively , it could have been corrupted from  little loddon  , the name of a stream that marks the southern extent of the village . little london at tadley would           second half of the 16th century . it was on a main drovers route into london , like that at oakley in buckinghamshire . there have been at least 70 communities established in england and wales , many of which still exist . they were temporary homes for the long distance drovers , moving their cattle to london , and the great fairs and markets of england . tadley was on the route to the fairs of blackbush , farnham , croydon and kingston , and london s smithfield market . the sites were established on common land away from other communities . the drovers had a licence to travel , granted by elizabeth 1st , and were regarded as foreigners by the local parishioners who could not travel without a settlement certificate .  governance  the village of little london is part of the civil parish of pamber , which covers pamber heath , pamber end , pamber green and little london and meets in pamber heath memorial hall and st. stephens hall , little london . it is also part of the pamber and silchester ward of basingstoke           non-metropolitan district of hampshire county council .  geography   community facilities  the main facility for the community is st. stephens hall , silchester road .  transport  the village is served by stagecoach in hampshire basingstoke bus routes 14 and 15 . the nearest railway station is east in bramley.  religious sites  the church of st. stephen on silchester road is part of the deanery of basingstoke and the diocese of winchester and is linked to the parish of bramley . there was also a methodist chapel on silchester road , built in 1867 which closed c1980 and was converted to a bed and breakfast .
birthplace = hamburg , holy roman empire johann franz encke was a german astronomer . among his activities , he worked on the calculation of the periods of comets and asteroids , measured the distance from the earth to the sun , and made observations of the planet saturn .  biography  encke was born in hamburg , where his father was a clergyman at the jakobskirche . he was the youngest of eight children - when his father died when he was four , the family in straitened circumstances . thanks to the financial assistance of a teacher , he was able to be educated at the gelehrtenschule des johanneums . he studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the university of gttingen under carl friedrich gauss ; but he enlisted in the hanseatic legion for the campaign of 18131814 , serving as a sergeant in the artillery of the prussian army , in holstein and mecklenburg . in 1814 he resumed his studies at the university but after napoleon s escape from elba he returned to the           become a lieutenant . having returned to gttingen in 1816 , he was at once appointed by bernhardt von lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of seeberg near gotha . there he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680 , for which the cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817 by judges gauss and olbers ; he correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812 . that comet is now called   12p/pons-brooks   . following a suggestion by jean-louis pons , who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805 , encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet . at this time , all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more , with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of uranus . the most famous comet of this family was comet halley with its period of seventy-six years . so the orbit of the comet discovered by pons           have a period of 3.3 years , so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of jupiter . encke predicted its return for 1822 , but this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by carl ludwig christian rmker in australia . the comet was also identified with the one seen by pierre mchain in 1786 and by caroline herschel in 1795 . encke sent his calculations as a note to gauss , olbers , and bessel . his former mathematics professor published this note and encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets . the first object of this family , the encke comet , was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer , but after the one who calculated the orbit . later this comet was identified as the origin of the taurids meteor showers . the importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by encke was rewarded by the royal astronomical society in london by presenting their gold medal to him in 1824 . in this year           author , bookseller and publisher rudolph zacharias becker , the publisher of works from the seeberg observatory . they had three sons and two daughters . in 1825 he was elected a fellow of the royal society . eight masterly treatises on the comet s movements were published by him in the   berliner abhandlungen   . from a fresh discussion of the transits of venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced a solar parallax of 8.57 arcsecond . this and the corresponding distance to the sun were long accepted as authoritative . his results were published in two separate tracts , entitled   die entfernung der sonne   . in 1822 he became director of the seeberg observatory , and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at berlin , where a new observatory , built under his superintendence and with the support of alexander von humboldt and king frederick william iii of prussia , was inaugurated in 1835 . mostly on the recommendation of bessel , encke became director of the new           directed the preparation of the star maps of the academy ; beginning in 1830 , he edited and greatly improved the   astronomisches jahrbuch   ; and he issued four volumes of the   astronomische beobachtungen auf der sternwarte zu berlin   . within the following time encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids . in 1837 , encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the a ring of saturn . the encke gap was later named in honor of his observations of saturn s rings . in 1844 , encke became professor for astronomy at the university of berlin . much labor was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids . with this end in view he expounded to the berlin academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations , and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates . encke visited england in 1840 . he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1836 . incipient brain-disease compelled him to withdraw from official life in november 1863 . he still was director of the berlin observatory until his death on 26 august 1865 in spandau . his successor was wilhelm julius foerster . he contributed extensively to the periodical literature of astronomy . encke s grave is preserved at a cemetery in the kreuzberg section of berlin , the   friedhof ii der jerusalems- und neuen kirchengemeinde   . his grave is close to that of the mathematician carl gustav jacob jacobi.  honors  *twice , in 1824 and 1830 , the recipient of the gold medal of the royal astronomical society . *the crater encke on the moon is named after him . *the           encke gap of saturn s rings is named after him . *the comet encke is named after him for his calculation of its orbit .  notes

a national monument in the united states is a protected area that is similar to a national park except that the president of the united states can declare an area of the united states to be a national monument without the approval of congress . however , areas within and extending beyond national parks , monuments , and national forests can be part of wilderness areas , which have an even greater degree of protection than a national park would alone , although wilderness areas managed by the united states forest service and bureau of land management often allow hunting and grazing . national monuments can be managed by one of several federal agencies : the national park service , united states forest service , united states fish and wildlife service , or bureau of land management . historically , some national monuments were managed by the u.s. war department national monuments can be so designated through the power of the antiquities act of 1906 . president theodore roosevelt used the act to declare devils tower national monument  history  the antiquities act of 1906 resulted from           states the reference in the act to objects of ... scientific interest enabled president theodore roosevelt to make a natural geology in 1908 , roosevelt used the act to proclaim more than of the grand canyon as a national monument . in 1918 , president woodrow wilson proclaimed katmai national monument in alaska , comprising more than 1000000acrekm2 lk=in . katmai was later enlarged to nearly 2800000acrekm2 lk=in by subsequent antiquities act proclamations and for many years was the largest national park system unit . petrified forest , grand canyon , and katmai were among the many national monuments later converted to national parks by congress . in response to roosevelt s declaration of the grand canyon monument , a putative mining claimant sued in federal court , claiming that roosevelt had overstepped the antiquities act authority by protecting an entire canyon . in 1920 , the united states supreme court ruled unanimously that the grand canyon was indeed an object of historic or scientific interest and could be protected by proclamation , setting a precedent for the use of the antiquities act to preserve large areas . federal courts have           antiquities act preservation authority . substantial opposition did not materialize until 1943 , when president franklin delano roosevelt in 1949 , for example , president harry s. truman proclaimed effigy mounds national monument to accept a donation of the land from the state of iowa , at the request of iowa s delegation . the most substantial use of the proclamation authority came in 1978 , when president jimmy carter proclaimed 15 new national monuments in alaska after congress had adjourned without passing a major alaska lands bill strongly opposed in that state . congress passed a revised version of the bill in 1980 incorporating most of these national monuments into national parks and preserves , but the act also curtailed further use of the proclamation authority in alaska . the proclamation authority was not used again anywhere until 1996 , when president bill clinton proclaimed the grand staircase-escalante national monument in utah . this action was widely unpopular in utah , and bills were introduced to further restrict the president s authority . to date , none of them have been enacted . most of the 16 national monuments created           service , but by the bureau of land management as part of the national landscape conservation system . new monuments managed by the park service are governors island national monument , virgin islands coral reef national monument , and , formerly ,   minidoka internment national monument   . george w. bush proclaimed two very different monuments in 2006 , the hundredth anniversary of the antiquities act . african burial ground national monument is a tiny archeological site in new york city . northwestern hawaiian islands national monument protects roughly 140000sqmikm2 lk=in of the pacific ocean , larger than all of america s national parks combined . . presidents have used the antiquities act s proclamation authority not only to create new national monuments but to enlarge existing ones . for example , franklin d. roosevelt significantly enlarged dinosaur national monument in 1938 . lyndon b. johnson added ellis island to statue of liberty national monument in 1965 , and jimmy carter made major additions to glacier bay national           bush used the antiquities act to create the mariana trench marine national monument , the pacific remote islands marine national monument , and the rose atoll marine national monument . in april 2012 president barack obama established the fort ord national monument in california s central coast region . in september 2012 , obama established the chimney rock national monument in colorado . and in october 2012 established the cesar e. chavez national monument . in march 2013 president barack obama designated five new national monuments : the charles young buffalo soldiers national monument in ohio , the first state national monument in delaware , the harriet tubman underground railroad national monument in maryland , the ro grande del norte national monument in new mexico , and the san juan islands national monument in washington . in may 2014 , president barack obama designated an additional national monument , the organ mountains-desert peaks national monument in new mexico  list of national monuments

cod liver oil is a nutritional supplement derived from liver of cod fish . as with most fish oils , it has high levels of the omega-3 fatty acids , eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid . cod liver oil also contains vitamin a and vitamin d. it has historically been taken because of its vitamin a and vitamin d content . it was once commonly given to children , because vitamin d has been shown to prevent rickets and other symptoms of vitamin d deficiency .  manufacture  cod liver oil was traditionally manufactured by filling a wooden barrel with fresh cod livers and seawater and allowing the mixture to ferment for up to a year before removing the oil . modern cod liver oil is made by cooking the whole cod body tissues of fatty fish during the manufacture of fish meal .  therapeutic uses  cod liver oil is widely taken to ease the pain and joint stiffness associated with arthritis . the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin a is 900 g per day for adult men and           15 g per day . the tolerable upper intake levels are 3000 g/day and 100 g/day respectively , so people consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin a and vitamin d this adds to their diet . a 300 mg soft gelatin capsule like those made by brands like seven seas and seacod by sanofi contain approximately 88 g vitamin a per dose . cod liver oil may be an effective complementary measure for long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis . use of cod liver oil during pregnancy is associated with lower risk of type i diabetes in the offspring . . this effect was found only in mothers taking cod liver oil , not in mothers taking multivitamin supplements . cod liver oil taken by nursing mothers improves the breast milk by increasing the amount of fatty acids , which promotes brain development , and the amount of vitamin a , which helps prevent infections , but the level of vitamin d is unchanged . a norwegian study of more than 68,000 women           oil supplements had significantly reduced mortality compared to women who did not take such supplements . vitamin a accumulates in the liver , and can reach harmful levels sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis a. pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of natural forms of vitamin a such as retinol . high doses of synthetic vitamin a have been shown to cause birth defects . a toxic dose of retinol is around 25 000 iu/kg ) , or the equivalent of about 1.25 kg of cod liver oil for a 50 kg person . there is an increased risk of prostate cancer in men taking supplements with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids , including cod liver oil . the risks of hypervitaminosis and of exposure to environmental toxins such as mercury , polychlorinated biphenyls , dioxins , and other contaminants , are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined           fatty acids , such as epa and dha . a high intake of cod liver oil by pregnant women is associated with a nearly fivefold increased risk of gestational hypertension.  other uses  in newfoundland , cod liver oil was sometimes used as the liquid base for traditional red ochre paint , the coating of choice for use on outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery . in tbingen , germany ; cod liver oil is used as the punishment for the loser at the traditional : de:stocherkahnrennen , a punting boat race by university groups .
  tree and leaf   is a small book published in 1964 , containing two works by j. r. r. tolkien : * a revised version of an essay called on fairy-stories * an allegorical short story called leaf by niggle . the book was originally illustrated by pauline baynes . mythopoeia was added to the 1988 edition . later versions also include the homecoming of beorhtnoth beorhthelm s son . both pieces were re-issued in the collection   the tolkien reader   , and have also appeared in various subsequent collections .
mary baker was a noted impostor who went by the name princess caraboo . she pretended to be from a far off island kingdom and fooled a british town for some months .  biography  on 3 april 1817 , a cobbler in almondsbury in gloucestershire , england , met an apparently disoriented young woman wearing exotic clothes who was speaking an incomprehensible language . the cobbler s wife took this stranger to the overseer of the poor , who placed her in the hands of the local county magistrate , samuel worrall , who lived in on the estate where tower house is located . worrall and his american-born wife elizabeth could not understand her either ; what they did determine was that she called herself caraboo and that she was interested in chinese imagery . they sent her to the local inn , where she identified a drawing of a pineapple with the word  ananas  , meaning pineapple in many indo-european languages , and insisted on sleeping on the floor . samuel worrall           bristol and tried for vagrancy . during her imprisonment , a portuguese sailor named manuel eynesso said he spoke her language and translated her story . according to enes , she was princess caraboo from the island of javasu in the indian ocean . she had been captured by pirates and after a long voyage she had jumped overboard in the bristol channel and swam ashore . the worralls brought caraboo to their home . for ten weeks , this representative of exotic royalty was a favourite of the local dignitaries . she used a bow and arrow , fenced , swam naked and prayed to a god , whom she named alla-tallah . she acquired exotic clothing and her portrait was painted and reproduced in local newspapers . her authenticity was attested to by a dr wilkinson , who identified her language using edmund fry s   pantographia   and stated that marks on the back of her head were the work of oriental surgeons . eventually the truth surfaced . a boarding-house keeper , mrs. neale , recognised her from the picture in           hosts . this would-be princess was in truth a cobbler s daughter , mary baker from witheridge , devon . she had been a servant girl around england but had found no place to stay . she invented her fictitious language from imaginary and gypsy words and created an exotic character and story . the odd marks on her head were scars from a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital in london . the british press had a field day at the expense of the duped rustic middle-class . her hosts arranged for her to travel to philadelphia and she departed 28 june 1817 . on 13 september 1817 a letter was printed in the   bristol journal   , allegedly from sir hudson lowe , the official in charge of the exiled emperor napoleon on st. helena . it claimed that after the philadelphia-bound ship bearing the beautiful caraboo had been driven close to the island by a tempest , the intrepid princess impulsively cut herself adrift in a small boat , rowed ashore and so fascinated the emperor that he was applying           that story is unverified . in the usa , she briefly continued her role , appearing on-stage at the washington hall , philadelphia , as  princess caraboo  , with little success . her last contact with the worralls was in a letter from new york in november 1817 , in which she complained of her notoriety . she appears to have returned to philadelphia until she left america in 1824 , returning to england . in 1824 she returned to britain and exhibited herself for a short time in new bond street , london , as  princess caraboo  but her act was not successful . she may have briefly travelled to france and spain in her guise , but soon returned to england . in september 1828 , she was living as a widow in bedminster under the name mary burgess . there she married richard baker , and gave birth to a daughter the following year . in 1839 , she was selling leeches to the bristol infirmary hospital . she died on 24 december 1864 and            film  the hoax provided material for a script , filmed in 1994 ,   princess caraboo   , written by michael austin and john wells , which added some fictional elements to the story .  notes

deathplace = lil hardin armstrong was a jazz pianist , composer , arranger , singer , and bandleader , and the second wife of louis armstrong with whom she collaborated on many recordings in the 1920s . hardin s compositions include struttin  with some barbecue , do nt jive me , two deuces , knee drops , doin  the suzie-q , just for a thrill , clip joint , and bad boy , her composition oriental swing was sampled heavily to create parov stelar s 2012 retro-song booty swing , which in turn gained notoriety when it was used in a 2013 chevrolet commercial .  background  she was born as lillian hardin in memphis , tennessee , where she grew up in a household with her grandmother , priscilla martin , a former slave from near oxford , mississippi . during her early years , hardin was taught hymns ,           drawn to popular music and later blues , but could only listen to or play these styles occasionally and covertly , because her mother , dempsey , a deeply religious woman , considered them sinful .  early education and mentors  hardin first received piano instruction from her third grade teacher , miss violet white , then her mother enrolled her in mrs. hook s school of music . i later learned that they had taught me all the wrong things , hardin recalled in 1971 , but they meant well . it was at fisk university , a college for african americans located in downtown nashville , that hardin was taught a more acceptable approach to the instrument . hardin stayed at the school for one year , returning to memphis in 1917 . in august 1918 , she moved to chicago with her mother and stepfather . by then , she had become proficient in reading music , a skill that landed her a job as a sheet music demonstrator at jones music store . the proprietor , jennie jones , also           performers to the store . a visit by jelly roll morton would profoundly affect hardin s musical education . he sat down , she wrote in her unpublished biography , the piano rocked , the floor shivered , the people swayed while he attacked the keyboard with his long skinny fingers , beating out a double rhythm with his feet on the loud pedal . oh , was i thrilled and amazed . he finally got up from the piano , grinned and looked at me as if to say ,  let this be a lesson to you .  well it was a lesson . when a small crowd urged hardin to play something for morton , she did . i laid witches dance and rachmaninoff s prelude in c sharp minor on him . morton s visit had a profound effect on hardin , who began embellishing the sheet music with her own ideas , much to the delight of customers . she had been on the job for three weeks when clarinetist lawrence duh s new orleans creole jazz band came in for an audition . jones           hardin there when duh was asked to add a pianist . i did my best to be a miniature jelly roll morton , she said , and duh decided to keep me . the store had been paying hardin $3 a week , but duh offered $22.50 . knowing that her mother would not approve of her working in a cabaret , she made it known that her new job was playing for a dancing school . three weeks later , the band moved on to a better booking at the de luxe caf , where the entertainers included florence mills and cora green . from there , the band moved up to the jewel of chicago s night life , the dreamland . here the principal entertainers were alberta hunter and ollie powers , and there was no finer night spot in chicago . when king oliver s creole jazz band replaced duh s group at the dreamland , oliver asked hardin to stay with him . she was with oliver at the dreamland in 1921 , when an offer came for the orchestra to play a six-month engagement at           that booking , hardin returned to chicago while the rest of the oliver band went on to los angeles .  marriages and divorces  in chicago , hardin went back to work at the dreamland , as pianist in an orchestra for mae brady , a violinist and vaudeville stalwart . while there , she fell for jimmie johnson , a young singer from washington , d.c. , whom she married on august 22 , 1922 . the marriage was short-lived , ending in divorce . in the meantime , the oliver band returned from california and opened at the royal gardens , with bertha gonzales at the piano , but soon found itself back at the dreamland , with hardin at the piano . his band was enjoying enormous success at the dreamland when king oliver sent for louis armstrong to join as second cornetist . armstrong was beginning to make a name for himself in their hometown , new orleans , and regarded oliver as his mentor . some say that oliver saw louis as a threat to his jazz throne and decided that           containment , although by all accounts both cornetists enjoyed working together . at first , hardin was unimpressed with louis , who arrived in chicago wearing clothes and a hair style that she deemed to be too country for chicago , but she worked to take the country out of him and a romance developed . she already had divorce experience and helped louis get a divorce from his first wife daisy , from whom he had separated back in new orleans . hardin and louis were married on february 4 , 1924 . hardin took louis shopping and taught him how to dress more fashionablyshe also got rid of his bangs , and began working on his career . recognizing his extraordinary talent , she felt that he was wasting it in a secondary role . louis was happy to be playing next to his idol , but hardin eventually persuaded him to leave oliver and go it on his own . armstrong eventually           , accepted a job with fletcher henderson in new york city . hardin stayed in chicago , first with oliver , then leading a band of her own . when hardin s band got a job at the dreamland caf in chicago , the following year , she prepared for louis  return to chicago by having a huge banner made to advertise him as the world s greatest trumpet player . louis was gaining an impressive reputation when richard m. jones convinced okeh records to make a series of sessions under his name : the classic armstrong hot five recordings . with hardin at the piano , kid ory on trombone , johnny dodds on clarinet , and johnny st. cyr on banjo , this stellar group rehearsed at louis and hardin s residence on chicago s east 41st street and held its first session on november 15 , 1925 . few recordings are as celebrated as the ones made by the hot five between then and the end of 1928 . hardin had actually           , in april and may 1926 . she also recorded a session for columbia records as the new orleans wanderers . in the late 1920s hardin and louis grew apart . armstrong formed a new hot five , with earl hines on piano . hardin reformed her own band with freddie keppard on cornet . louis and hardin separated in 1931 , when he had begun a liaison with alpha smith , who threatened to sue armstrong for breach of promise , so he begged hardin not to grant him a divorce . i felt sorry for louis , hardin later recalled , but he had two-timed me , so i gave him a divorce just to teach him a lessonand i sued him , too .  later years  in the 1930s , sometimes billing herself as mrs. louis armstrong , hardin led an all girl orchestra , then a mixed gender big band which broadcast nationally over the nbc radio network . the same decade she recorded a series of sides for decca records as a swing ( genre           early 1950s , hardin worked mostly as a soloist singing and playing piano . in the late 1940s , she decided to leave the music and become a tailor , so she took a course in tailoring . her graduation project was to make a tuxedo for louis . it was displayed prominently at a new york cocktail party she threw to announce her new field of endeavor . they looked at louis  tux and all the other things i had made and they were very impressed , she recalled , but then someone asked me to play the piano . that s when i knew that i would never be able to leave the music business . louis wore hardin s tuxedo and she continued to tailor , but only as a sideline and then only for friends . her shirts , which friends received regularly on birthdays , proudly bore a label with her mother s name , decie , and beneath that , hand made by lil armstrong . hardin eventually returned to chicago and the house on east 41st street . she also made a trip           , but mostly she worked around chicago , often with fellow chicagoans . collaborators included red saunders , joe williams , oscar brown , jr. , and little brother montgomery . in the 1950s , hardin recorded a biographical narrative for riverside s bill grauer , which was issued in lp form . she would again appear on that label in 1961 , participating in its chicago : the living legends project as accompanist for alberta hunter and leader of her own hastily assembled big band . at that time , her favorite living pianists were thelonious monk and billy taylor , which helps to explain why , when riverside producer chris albertson approached her about these recordings , her immediate reaction was , who s going to listen to that old stuff ? the riverside recordings led to her inclusion in a star-studded 1961 nbc network special , chicago and all that jazz , and a follow-up album released through the verve records imprint . in 1962 , hardin began writing her autobiography , in collaboration with albertson , but she had second thoughts when she realized that such a           might discomfit louis armstrong , so the project was shelved with only five chapters written .  death  when armstrong died , in 1971 , hardin was deeply shaken by the loss . she traveled to new york for the funeral and rode in the family car . i think louis would have found a way getting back at me if

  acrobates     distoechurus   the acrobatidae are a small family of gliding marsupials containing two genera , each with a single species , the feathertail glider from australia and feather-tailed possum from new guinea . this family of the diprotodontia order , which can be found in the east coast and inland of australia and in some islands of new guinea , is characterized by their very small size , which has side effects : because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small , heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals . therefore , when temperature drops or food is scarce , they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity which can last between one day and two weeks . in this state           drops to almost that of its surroundings , and the animal becomes unresponsive .  taxonomy  * family acrobatidae ** genus   acrobates   *** feathertail glider ,   acrobates pygmaeus   ** genus   distoechurus   *** feather-tailed possum ,   distoechurus pennatus  
establishedtitle = mato grosso is one of the states of brazil , the third largest by area , located in the western part of the country . neighboring states are rondnia , amazonas , par , tocantins , gois and mato grosso do sul . it also borders bolivia to the southwest . a state with a flat landscape , alternating great   chapadas   and plain areas , mato grosso presents three different ecosystems : cerrado , pantanal and the amazon rainforest . the vegetation of the open pasture covers 40% of the state , and the chapada dos guimares national park , with its caves , grottos , tracks and waterfalls , is one of its great tourist attractions . in the north is the amazonian forest , with a biodiversity covering half of the state . the xingu national park and the araguaia river are in mato grosso . further south , the pantanal , the world s largest wetland , is the habitat for almost a thousand species of animals ,           the mato grosso is the chapada dos guimares , a unique and beautiful environment made from sandstone mountains and their subsequent erosion . the terrain of the mato grosso is varied and includes cliffs , canyons , and beautiful waterfalls . the biologically rich pantanal , one of the world s largest wetland/prairie ecosystems , is also located within this state . much environmental degradation has occurred to the pantanal within the past few decades , and it shows no sign of stopping anytime soon . the pantanal can be compared to the everglades in florida , as both share much in common , habitat wise , although the pantanal is of much larger scale .  history  in 1977 , the state was split into two halves , with mato grosso do sul becoming a new state . the bororo indians live in the mato grosso area . as late as 1880 , soldiers patrolled lands on the outskirts of cuiab , mato grosso s capital and largest city , to protect settlers from bororo raids . by the end of the 19th century , although severely reduced by           prospectors , settlers , and other indigenous groups , as many as five to ten thousand bororo continued to occupy central and eastern mato grosso , as well as western gois . the southwestern part of it was ceded to bolivia in exchange for acre , according to treaty of petrpolis in 1903 . the historic remoteness of this area led it to be the subject of exploration , most notably by captain percy fawcett , in the quest for lost cities . it was also the rumored location of access to the interior of the earth in various hollow earth theories .  demographics  mato grosso had a high rate of population growth in the 20th century . despite this , the state as a whole has one of the lowest population densities of any brazilian state . ethnically , the state includes a relatively high proportion of caboclos , as do other areas of the interior . according to the ibge of 2008 , 3,010,000 people resided in the state . the population density was 3.2 inh. /km .           2.4% ; houses : 836,000 . the last pnad census revealed the following numbers : 1,532,000 brown people , 1,179,000 white people , 239,000 black people , 41,000 amerindian people , 14,000 asian people .  economy  agriculture is the largest component of gdp at 40.8% , followed by the service sector at 40.2% . the industrial sector represents 19% of gdp . mato grosso exports : soybeans 83% , wood 5.6% , meats 4.8% , and cotton 3.3% . the state s share of the brazilian economy is 1.7% .  statistics  vehicles : 745,810 ; mobile phones : 323,000 ; telephones : 527,000 ; cities : 141 .  education  portuguese is the official national language , as well as the primary language taught in schools . however , english and spanish are           more than 58 universities in state of mato grosso . cuiab is home to the following universities : * federal university of mato grosso ; * state university of mato grosso ; * universidade de cuiab  culture  the local culture is very rich , due to the influences of and encounters with various cultures , such as native americans , the original settlers , the africans enslaved originally by the portuguese , and europeans , beginning with the portuguese settlers and other european immigrants who arrived later . two long periods of isolation also contributed to its differentiation , which has been somewhat diluted by recent immigration . cuiab has an interesting cuisine influenced by natives , with their typical dances , craftwork , and music . dance and music were traditionally connected to the worship of catholic saints and their festivals , saint benedict , being one of the favorite .  carnival  the four-day period before lent leading up to ash wednesday , known as carnival is well celebrated . as           holiday in a typical fashion - including parades , music , and dance - with wide participation .  tourism and recreation   alta floresta  fishing in the teles pires , so benedito and azul rivers is productive practically all year long . bird watching : with the more than 570 species of catalogued birds and new species being discovered every year , the region of alta floresta , cristalino and azul river basin receives constant visits from famous ornithologists and bird watchers .  chapada dos guimares  the largest sandstone cavern in brazil , aroe jari , extends nearly 1550 meters and several prehistoric inscriptions can be found inside .  north pantanal  the pantanal s backbone is the paraguay river , which cuts through the region from north to south . the miranda , aquidauna , taquari and cuiaba rivers flow into the paraguay river . from october to april , the high waters reveal outsized lakes , bays , river branches and outlets . the transpantaneira highway connects the town of pocone to jofre port , along the cuiab river bank . it is           for 149 km . on the way , it is possible to observe wild animals , especially alligators , capybaras and birds , among other wild animals . sesc s private natural heritage reserve increases by one-third the total area of this preserved ecosystem in the state of mato grosso . over 160 different species of birds have been observed in the pantanal , and still many species in the area have not yet been identified . file:rio paraguai passando por cceres1.jpgparaguay river in mato grosso file:salgadeira extension.jpgsalgadeira waterfall **27;105507;toolong waterfall **25;105536;toolong in mato grosso file:cuiab vista do rio.jpgcuiab river  infrastructure   international airport  the runway at marechal rondon international airport was opened to traffic in 1956 . in february 1975 , infraero took over the airport s administration and began various upgrades to meet the needs of the airport complex . as of 1996 , marechal rondon international airport , located 10 km from the city center , started receiving international flights . currently , it serves more than half a million passengers a year .  highways           * br-158 ;

an intraplate earthquake is an earthquake that occurs in the interior of a tectonic plate , whereas an interplate earthquake is one that occurs at a plate boundary . intraplate earthquakes are relatively rare . interplate earthquakes , which occur at plate boundaries , are more common . nonetheless , very large intraplate earthquakes can inflict heavy damage , particularly because such areas are not accustomed to earthquakes and buildings are usually not seismically retrofitted . examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating gujarat earthquake in 2001 , the 2012 indian ocean earthquakes , the 1811-1812 earthquakes in new madrid , missouri , and the 1886 earthquake in charleston , south carolina .  fault zones within tectonic plates  the surface of the earth is made up of seven primary and eight secondary tectonic plates , plus dozens of tertiary microplates . the large plates move very slowly , owing to convection currents within the mantle below the crust . because they do not all move in the same direction , plates often directly collide or move laterally along each other , a tectonic environment that           environments ; most occur on faults near plate margins . by definition , intraplate earthquakes do not occur near plate boundaries , but along faults in the normally stable interior of plates . these earthquakes often occur at the location of ancient failed rifts , because such old structures may present a weakness in the crust where it can easily slip to accommodate regional tectonic strain . compared to earthquakes near plate boundaries , intraplate earthquakes are not well understood , and the hazards associated with them may be difficult to quantify .  historic examples  historic examples of intraplate earthquakes include those in mineral , virginia in 2011 , new madrid in 1811 and 1812 , the boston earthquake of 1755 , earthquakes felt in new york city in 1737 and 1884 , and the charleston earthquake in south carolina in 1886 . the charleston quake was particularly surprising           had almost no history of even minor earthquakes . in 2001 , a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of gujarat , india . the earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries , which meant the region above the epicenter was unprepared for earthquakes . in particular , the kutch district suffered tremendous damage , where the death toll was over 12,000.  causes  many cities live with the seismic risk of a rare , large intraplate earthquake . the cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain . in many cases , the causative fault is deeply buried , and sometimes can not even be found . under these circumstances it is difficult to calculate the exact seismic hazard for a given city , especially if there was only one earthquake in historical times . some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics driving these earthquakes .  prediction  scientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes , and especially for some indication of how often they recur . the best success has come with detailed micro-seismic monitoring , involving dense arrays of seismometers .           causative fault can be located with great accuracy , and in most cases these line up in patterns consistent with faulting . cryoseisms can sometimes be mistaken for intraplate earthquakes .

a bathroom is a room for personal hygiene , generally containing a bathtub or a shower , and possibly also a bidet . in north america and some other regions , it characteristically contains a toilet and a sink ; hence in north american english the word bathroom is commonly used to mean any room containing a toilet , even a public toilet . in other countries , including the uk , australia , france and japan , homes may have a separate toilet . in iran almost all homes have two distinct rooms for bathroom and toilet room .  history  the first records for the use of baths date back as far as 3000 b.c. at this time water had a strong religious value , being seen as a purifying element for both body and soul , and so it was not uncommon for people to be required to cleanse themselves before entering a sacred area . baths are recorded as part of a village or town life throughout this period           america and cold baths in asia . communal baths were erected in a distinctly separate area to the living quarters of the village , with a view to preventing evil spirits from entering the domestic quarters of a commune . according to teresi et al . :  the third millennium b.c. was the age of cleanliness . toilets and sewers were invented in several parts of the world , and mohenjo-daro circa 2800 b.c. had some of the most advanced , with lavatories built into the outer walls of houses . these were western-style toilets made from bricks with wooden seats on top . they had vertical chutes , through which waste fell into street drains or cesspits . sir mortimer wheeler , the director general of archaeology in india from 1944 to 1948 , wrote , the high quality of the sanitary arrangements could well be envied in many parts of the world today .   nearly all of the hundreds of houses excavated had their own bathing rooms . generally located on the ground floor , the bath was made of brick , sometimes           drained away through a hole in the floor , down chutes or pottery pipes in the walls , into the municipal drainage system . even the fastidious egyptians rarely had special bathrooms .  not all ancient baths were in the style of the large pools that often come to mind when one imagines the roman baths ; the earliest surviving bathtub dates back to 1700 b.c , and hails from the palace of knossos in crete . what is remarkable about this tub is not only the similarity with the baths of today , but also the way in which the plumbing works surrounding it differ so little from modern models . a more advanced prehistoric system of baths and plumbing is to be found in the excavated town of akrotiri , on the aegean island of thera . there , alabaster tubs and other bath fittings were found , along with a sophisticated twin plumbing system to transport hot and cold water separately . this was probably because of easy access to geothermic hot springs on this volcanic island . both the           an important part of their lifestyles . writers such as homer had their heroes bathe in warm water so as to regain their strength ; it is perhaps notable that the mother of achilles bathed him in order to gain his invincibility . palaces have been uncovered throughout greece with areas that are dedicated to bathing , spaces with ceramic bathtubs , as well as sophisticated drainage systems . homer uses the word ,   loetr   , baths , later ,   loutr   , from the verb ,   loein   , to bathe . the same root finds an even earlier attestation on linear b tablets , in the name of the river lousios , in arcadia . public baths are mentioned by the comedian aristophanes as ,   balanea   . the roman attitudes towards bathing are well documented ; they built large purpose-built thermal baths , marking not only an important social development           rejuvenation . here was a place where people could meet to discuss the matters of the day and enjoy entertainment . during this period there was a distinction between private and public baths , with many wealthy families having their own thermal baths in their houses . despite this they still made use of the public baths , showing the value that they had as a public institution . the strength of the roman empire was telling in this respect ; imports from throughout the world allowed the roman citizens to enjoy ointments , incense , combs , and mirrors . although some sources suggest that bathing declined following the collapse of the roman empire , this is not completely accurate . it was actually the middle ages that saw the beginning of soap production , proof that bathing was definitely not uncommon . it was only after the renaissance that bathing declined ; water was feared as a carrier of disease , and thus sweat baths and heavy perfumes were preferred . in fact throughout the 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries , the use of public baths declined           , thus laying the foundations for the bathroom , as it was to become , in the 20th century . however in japan shared bathing in sento and onsen still exists ; the latter being very popular .  variations   powder room  a powder room also called 1/2 bath or guest bath usually refers to a room with a toilet and a sink and commonly used by guests .  shower room  a shower room or shower-room is a room that contains a shower cubicle , but no bathtub . in the united states , this would be called a   3/4 bathroom   .  ensuite  an ensuite bathroom or ensuite shower room is a bathroom or shower room attached to and only accessible from a bedroom .  family bathroom  a family bathroom , in british estate agent terminology , is a full bathroom in a house .  jack and jill bathroom  a jack and jill bathroom is a bathroom with            a wetroom is a waterproof room usually equipped with a shower . it is designed to eliminate moisture damage that is caused to a home and is also compatible with the heating systems beneath the floor .  regional differences   australia and new zealand  in australia , new zealand and other british commonwealth countries it is common for a bathroom to   not   contain a lavatory ; but with a separate  toilet  next door .  terminology in the united states  in the united states , bathrooms are generally categorized as master bathroom , containing a shower and a tub that is adjoining to a master bedroom , a full bathroom , containing four plumbing fixtures : bathtub , shower , toilet , and sink ; half bath containing just a toilet and sink ; and 3/4 bath containing toilet , sink , and shower , although the terms vary from market           , sink , and shower are considered a full bath . this lack of a single , universal definition commonly results in discrepancies between advertised and actual number of baths in real estate listings . an additional complication is that there are currently two ways of notating the number of bathrooms in a dwelling . one method is to count a half bathroom as .5 and then add this to the number of full bathrooms . the other , newer method is to put the number of full bathrooms to the left side of the decimal point and to put the number of half bathrooms to the right of the decimal point .  design considerations  the design of a bathroom must account for the use of both hot and cold water , in significant quantities , for cleaning the human body . the water is also used for moving           tank . water may be splashed on the walls and floor , and hot humid air may cause condensation on cold surfaces . from a decorating point of view the bathroom presents a challenge . ceiling , wall and floor materials and coverings should be impervious to water and readily and easily cleaned . the use of ceramic or glass , as well as smooth plastic materials , is common in bathrooms for their ease of cleaning . such surfaces are often cold to the touch , however , and so water-resistant bath mats or even bathroom carpets may be used on the floor to make the room more comfortable . alternatively , the floor may be heated , possibly by strategically placing heater conduits close to the surface . electrical appliances , such as lights , heaters , and heated towel rails , generally need to be installed as fixtures , with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets . this minimizes the risk of electric shock . ground-fault circuit interruptor electrical sockets can reduce the risk of electric shock , and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical           in some countries , such as the united kingdom , only special sockets suitable for electric shavers are permitted in bathrooms , and are labelled as such . uk building regulations also define what type of electrical light fittings may be installed in the areas around and above baths , sinks and showers . bathroom lighting should be uniform , bright and must minimize glare . for all the activities like shaving , showering , grooming etc. one must ensure equitable lighting across the entire bathroom space . the mirror area should definitely have at least two sources of light at least 1 feet apart to eliminate any shadows on the face . skin tones and hair color are highlighted with a tinge of yellow light .  see also  * bathroom cabinet * toilet * washroom

from   kantonsschule frauenfeld   in 1887 , he began law studies at the university of zrich and continued his studies at the university of leipzig and at the humboldt university in berlin . while in leipzig which was the german stronghold for jurisprudence , he formed a friendship with prinz ferdinand von hohenzollern-sigmaringen , who was later crowned king ferdinand i. of great romania . though their ways parted , they met again years later when king ferdinand i. was on an official state visit in switzerland . hberlin received his lawyers license in 1891 and completed a short internship in lausanne at the lawyers office of federal councillor louis ruchonnet . in 1892 he opened his own law firm in weinfelden , which two years later he moved to the canton capital of frauenfeld . he quickly gained a reputation for being an outstanding lawyer and became the most sought after in this area of switzerland . from 1899 to 1920 he presided over the district court frauenfeld . hberlin got actively           judges and lawyers at that time . and in 1904 he was elected into the swiss federal council of which he was president in 1918-1919 . in addition to his political activities at the national level , hberlin was also active in local politics in the canton of thurgau . in 1905 he was elected to the grand council of the canton of thurgau , where he served for 15 years . twice he was appointed president of the grand council . following the resignation of federal councillor calonder , hberlin was elected in the first ballot with 124 out of 159 votes as successor on february 12 , 1920 . while in office he was in charge of the justice and police department . during his time in the federal council , he was president of the swiss confederation in 1926 and 1931 . hberlin was to a large extent instrumental in the unification of criminal law . characteristic of his tenure were particularly two rejected laws by the people for the expansion of state security laws , which became known as lex hberlin i           to protect the civil and democratic state against extremist influences . and in the wake of the rise of nazism in germany , he was strongly condemning fascist and nazi totalitarianism based on his democratic-liberal attitude and was warning of the danger of hitlers martial aspirations as early as 1932 . moreover , he was highly regarded for his expertise in his chosen field , the sharpness and preciseness of his dialectic skills , wit and humour . he was known for having a strong sense of justice , whether royalty , upper class , or common people , he treated them all equally . with the collapse of the austro-hungarian empire , kaiser karl i. and his wife zita von bourbon-parma went into exile in switzerland . kaiser karl i. gave his word of honor to the swiss authorities to give notification in case of any intentions of travelling abroad , however , he broke it twice and went to hungary in a futile attempt to restore the monarchy and to regain power over his lost empire . after that , based on hberlins initiative , the whole family and           their violation of swiss asylum law and were asked to leave . nevertheless when one of the children of empress zita came down with appendectomy and needed to undergo surgery in zrich , hberlin granted them visa extensions for the time being .  retirement  even after his retirement he was still much sought after in important matters . he became a board member of one of the biggest swiss insurance companies winterthur , and also first president of pro helvetia , and was friends and acquaintance with such diverse personalities as the famous german writer hermann hesse , and walter mittelholzer who was not only a pioneer of swiss aviation but also one of the first aviation entrepreneurs . others included the nobel prize winner for literature romain rolland , the swiss painters cuno amiet who is considered a pioneer of modern art in switzerland and carl liner among others . hberlin died 1947 in frauenfeld.  anecdotes  hberlins most famous and interesting client at the time when he practiced law in weinfelden was certainly the airship inventor count ferdinand von zeppelin . in hberlins           1934 in which he writes that count zeppelin was among other things his client in manners such as border disputes with the eminent psychiatrist ludwig binswanger who was running an exclusive psychiatric clinic nearby , the sanatorium bellevue . when hberlin and the count were discussing business matters in the lounge of the counts family estate schloss girsberg , it was not rare that they heard the propeller noise of count zeppelins airship passing by . in moments like these , count zeppelins attention was drawn away from matters at hand and hberlin suggested , excellency , shall we take a break until the airship has passed ? , upon which count zeppelin stood up , went to the window with a smile , saying , yes , you are right , sir . in the rare moments of leisurely life , hberlin found a lot of comfort in mountaineering and one day he took his wife to the beautiful alpine village of zermatt and when he was introducing her to the different peaks surrounding it , an american tourist standing nearby overheard his explanations and assumed hberlin           and asked politely if it was possible to have him - the president of the federal council of switzerland - as a mountain guide . in his usual manner of being low-key , the president politely explained to the american that he was on a holiday with his wife to show her the natural wonders of the swiss alps and thus wasnt the mountain guide the gentlemen had mistaken him to be . during wwi hberlin was a regiment commander and was stationed with his troops in the swiss alps . - in those days it was strongly prohibited for the soldier in charge of guarding horse carriages to ride on top of the carriage , instead the soldier had the duty to run behind the carriage in case anything of the load fell off during the transportation . needless to say , the soldier on duty was not too thrilled with this task , especially when the carriage was empty after delivering the goods and still he was not allowed to ride on it . so one day a guard of hberlins regiment sat next up to the coachman on           their goods at the designated area . they were going on a mountainous road which had many turns , when all of a sudden hberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it . the flabbergasted soldier answered in all honesty , because colonel , sir , i have noticed you too late ! , upon hearing this , hberlin started to laugh heartily and let the soldier off the hook due to the guards honesty .  further

religious art or sacred art is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual . sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist s religious tradition .  christian art  christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate , supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of christianity , though other definitions are possible . most christian groups use or have used art to some extent , although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image , and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within christianity . most christian art is allusive , or built around themes familiar to the intended observer . one of the most common christian themes is that of the virgin mary holding the infant jesus . another is that of christ on the cross . for the benefit of the illiterate , an elaborate iconographic system developed to conclusively identify scenes . for example , saint agnes depicted with a           a shamrock . each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art .  history  early christian art survives from dates near the origins of christianity . the oldest surviving christian paintings are from the site at megiddo , dated to around the year 70 , and the oldest christian sculptures are from sarcophagi , dating to the beginning of the 2nd century . until the adoption of christianity by constantine christian art derived its style and much of its iconography from popular roman art , but from this point grand christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for christian versions of roman elite and official art , of which mosaics in churches in rome are the most prominent surviving examples . during the development of christian art in the byzantine empire , a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in hellenistic art . this new style was hieratic , meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people . realistic perspective , proportions , light and color were ignored           and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events . the controversy over the use of   graven images   , the interpretation of the second commandment , and the crisis of byzantine iconoclasm led to a standardization of religious imagery within the eastern orthodoxy . the renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works , but until the protestant reformation christian art continued to be produced in great quantities , both for churches and clergy and for the laity . during this time , michelangelo buonarroti painted the sistine chapel and carved the famous   piet   , gianlorenzo bernini created the massive columns in st. peter s basilica , and leonardo da vinci painted the   last supper   . the reformation had a huge effect on christian art , rapidly bringing the production of public christian art to a virtual halt in protestant countries , and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed . as a secular , non-sectarian , universal notion of art arose in 19th century western europe , secular artists occasionally treated christian themes . however many modern artists such as eric gill , marc chagall , henri matisse , jacob epstein , elizabeth frink and graham sutherland have produced well-known works of art for churches . since the advent of printing , the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular christian culture . in the nineteenth century , this included genre painters such as mihly munkcsy . the invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of holy cards . in the modern era , companies specializing in modern commercial christian artists such as thomas blackshear and thomas kinkade , although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch , have been very successful . the last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith , christ , god , the church , the bible and other classic christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world           both in sacred and secular arts . other notable artists include larry d. alexander , gary p. bergel , carlos cazares , bruce herman , deborah sokolove , and john august swanson .   see also madonna and child , icon , images of jesus    buddhist art  buddhist art originated on the indian subcontinent following the historical life of siddhartha gautama , 6th to 5th century bc , and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout asia and the world . buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread , adapted , and evolved in each new host country . it developed to the north through central asia and into eastern asia to form the northern branch of buddhist art , and to the east as far as southeast asia to form the southern branch of buddhist art . in india , buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of hindu art , until buddhism nearly disappeared in india around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of islam alongside hinduism.  tibetan buddhist art  most tibetan           buddhist tantra . tibetan art includes thangkas and mandalas , often including depictions of buddhas and bodhisattvas . creation of buddhist art is usually done as a meditation as well as creating an object as aid to meditation . an example of this is the creation of a sand mandala by monks ; before and after the construction prayers are recited , and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings of a buddha on which is meditated to train the mind . the work is rarely , if ever , signed by the artist . other tibetan buddhist art includes metal ritual objects , such as the vajra and the phurba.  indian buddhist art  two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century ad . one is ajanta , a site in india long forgotten until discovered in 1817 . the other is dunhuang , one of the great oasis staging posts on the silk road ... the paintings range from calm devotional images of the buddha to lively and crowded scenes , often           indian sculpture than in painting . major art included mosques and a madonna  islamic art  a prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art , as well as the naturally decorative nature of arabic script , led to the use of calligraphic decorations , which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns that expressed ideals of order and nature . it was used on religious architecture , carpets , and handwritten documents . islamic art has reflected this balanced , harmonious world-view . it focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form . while there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through islamic history , this is a distinctly modern sunni view . persian miniatures , along with medieval depictions of muhammad and angels in islam , stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern sunni tradition . also , shia muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures , including the prophets as long as the depiction is respectful .  figure representation in islamic sacred art  the islamic resistance to the representation of living beings           forms is unique to god , and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial.he strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the hadith , where painters are challenged to breathe life into their creations and threatened with punishment on the day of judgment . the quran is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the arabic term musawwir as an epithet for god . partially as a result of this religious sentiment , figures in painting were often stylized and , in some cases , the destruction of figurative artworks occurred . iconoclasm was previously known in the byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the judaic world , thus placing the islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context . as ornament , however , figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge . as with other forms of islamic ornamentation , artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms , giving rise            calligraphy is the most highly regarded and most fundamental element of islamic art . it is significant that the quran , the book of god s revelations to the prophet muhammad , was transmitted in arabic , and that inherent within the arabic script is the potential for developing a variety of ornamental forms . the employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying talismanic component . while most works of art had legible inscriptions , not all muslims would have been able to read them . one should always keep in mind , however , that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text , albeit in a decorative form . from its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century a.d. , the arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art . the main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles , called generally the kufic , and the soft cursive styles , which include naskhi , thuluth , nastaliq and many others           the three nonfigural types of decoration in islamic art , which also include calligraphy and vegetal patterns . whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation , geometric patterns are popularly associated with islamic art , largely due to their aniconic quality . these abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types
the tamaraw or mindoro dwarf buffalo , with the scientific name   bubalus mindorensis   , is a small , hoofed mammal belonging to the family bovidae . it is endemic to the island of mindoro in the philippines , and is the only endemic philippine bovine . it is believed , however , to have once also thrived on the larger island of luzon . the tamaraw was originally found all over mindoro , from sea level up to the mountains , but because of human habitation , hunting , and logging , it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species . contrary to common belief and past classification , the tamaraw is not a subspecies of the local carabao , which is only slightly larger , or the common water buffalo . in contrast to the carabao , it has a number of distinguishing characteristics : it is slightly hairier , has light markings on its face , is not gregarious , and has shorter horns that are           in the country .  anatomy and morphology    bubalus mindorensis   has the appearance of a typical member of its family . it has a compact , heavyset , bovine body , four legs that end in cloven hooves and a small , horned head at the end of a short neck . it is smaller and stockier compared to the asiatic water buffalo . there is little sexual dimorphism in the species although males are reported to have thicker necks . the tamaraw has an average shoulder height of 100-105cm in . the length of the body is 2.2m ft while the tail adds a further 60cm in . reported weights have ranged from 180to300kg lb . adults have a dark brown to grayish color and more hair than   bubalus bubalis   . the limbs are short and stocky . white markings are seen in the hooves and the inner lower forelegs . these markings are similar to that of the anoa   bubalus depressicornis   . the face is the same color           of the species also has a pair of gray-white strips that begins from the inner corner of the eye to the horns . the nose and lips have black skin . the ears are 13.5 centimeters long from notch to tip with white markings on the insides . both sexes grows short black horns in a v-shaped manner compared to c-shaped horns of   bubalus bubalis   . the horns have flat surfaces and are triangular at their base . due to the regular rubbing , the tamaraw s horns have a worn outer surface but with rough inner sides . the horns are reported to be 35.5 to 51.0 centimeters long . however as anti-malarial medicine was developed , more people settled on the island . the increase in human activity has drastically reduced tamaraw population . by 1966 the tamaraw s range was reduced to three areas : mount iglit , mount calavite and areas near the sablayan penal settlement . by 2000 , their range was further reduced to only two areas : the mounts iglit-baco national park and aruyan . initial estimates of the            at around 10,000 individuals in the early 1900s . less than fifty years later in 1949 , the population had dwindled to around a thousand individuals . by 1953 , fewer than 250 animals were estimated to be alive . these population estimates continually grew smaller until the iucn publication of their 1969 red data book , where the tamaraw population was noted to be an alarmingly low 100 heads . this head count rose to 120 animals in 1975 . current estimates place the wild tamaraw population from thirty to two hundred individuals .  ecology and life history  as a rare , endemic mammal on a relatively secluded island , the ecology of the tamaraw is largely unknown . individuals of the species are reclusive and shy away from humans . in addition , the small sizes of the species  subpopulations , already spread thin throughout their fragmented range , make contact with any more than a solitary individual a rarity .  habitat    bubalus mindorensis             in thick brush , near open-canopied glades where it may graze and feed on grasses . since human habitation and subsequent forest fragmentation of their home island of mindoro , the habitat preferences of the tamaraw have somewhat expanded to lower-altitude grassy plains . within their mountainous environment , tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water .  trophic ecology  the tamaraw is a grazer that feeds on grasses and young bamboo shoots although it is known to prefer cogon and   talahib   . they are naturally diurnal , feeding during the daytime hours ; however , daytime human activities have recently forced select   b. mindorensis   individuals to be nocturnal to avoid human contact .  life history  the tamaraw is known to live for about 20 years , with an estimated lifespan of about 25 . the adult female tamaraw gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of about 300 days . there is an interbirth interval of two years , although one female has been sighted           with its mother before becoming independent .  behavioral ecology  unlike the closely related water buffalo ,   b. mindorensis   is a solitary creature . adults of the species do not occur in herds or smaller packs and are often encountered alone . only juveniles exhibit the typical bovine herding behavior and clan hierarchy often seen in water buffalo . males and females are known to associate all year round but this interaction lasts only a few hours . it has been suggested that this solitary behavior is an adaptation to its forest environment . adult males are often solitary and apparently aggressive while adult females can be alone , accompanied by a bull , or three young of different ages . similar to other bovines , the tamaraw wallows in mud pits . it has been suggested that this behavior is employed by the animals in order to avoid biting insects . another distinct behavior in   b. mindorensis   is their fierceness . there are reports concerning their fierceness when cornered although most are unsubstantiated . threat posture used by the bovine involves           vertical position . this is accompanied with a lateral shaking of the head .  evolutionary history  the presence of   b. mindorensis   on the island of mindoro , coupled with the discovery of fossil bubalids in other islands around the archipelago indicates that the family was once widespread throughout the philippines . recent genetic analysis studies of the family members further strengthen this view .  etymology and taxonomic history  the tamaraw was originally described as   anoa mindorensis   by the french zoologist pierre marie heude in 1888 . in 1958 , it was described as   anoa bubalis mindorensis   , a subspecies of the then-water buffalo species . a little over a decade after , the tamaraw was elevated to species status as   anoa mindorensis   in 1969 . the name   tamaraw   has other variants like   tamarau   ,   tamarou   and   tamarao   . it has been suggested that the term             which is a probable alternative name for the banteng .  conservation  being an entirely endemic and rare land mammal ,   bubalus mindorensis   stands as an extremely vulnerable species . currently , it is classified as a critically endangered species and has been so since 2000 by the iucn on its iucn red list of endangered species . awareness of the conservation status of   bubalus mindorensis   began way back in 1965 when it was classified as   status inadequately known   by the iucn . enough data was gathered on the tamaraw population by 1986 , and the iucn conservation monitoring center declared the species endangered . throughout succeeding surveys conducted in 1988 , 1990 , 1994 and 1996 , the species remained listed on the red list as   endangered   . the relisting of the species in 1996 fulfilled the iucn criteria   b1+2c   and   d1   . criterion   b1   indicated that the species  range was less           less than five independent locations . a noticed continuing decline in the population fulfilled sub-criterion   2c   , given the condition of the population s sole habitat . criterion   d1   essentially required that a population be composed of less than 250 mature individuals ; individual counts of the   b. mindorensis   population at the time figured significantly lower than this . in 2000 , the tamaraw was relisted on the red list under the more severe   c1   criteria . this was due to estimates that the population would decline by 20% in five years or within the timespan of two generations . many factors have contributed to the decline of the tamaraw population . over the course of the century , the increase of the human population on mindoro has exposed the island s sole tamaraw population to severe anthropogenic pressures . in the 1930s , the introduction of non-native cattle on the island caused a severe rinderpest epidemic among the tamaraw population then-numbering in the thousands . hunting of tamaraws for food and sustenance has also           most major factor threatening survival of   b. mindorensis   is habitat loss due to infrastructure development , logging and agriculture . these factors reduced the population of thousands during the early 1900s to less than 300 individuals in 2007 . due to the decline of the   b. mindorensis   population , various philippine laws and organizations have been created towards the conservation of the species . in 1936 , commonwealth act no. 73 was enacted by the then-philippine commonwealth . the act specifically prohibited killing , hunting and even merely wounding tamaraws , with an exception noted for self-defense or for scientific purposes . the penalties were harsh enough to include a hefty fine and imprisonment . in 1979 , an executive order was signed creating a committee specifically geared towards the conservation of the tamaraw . the tamaraw was referred to as a source of national pride in the said e.o . the tamaraw conservation project was also established in 1979 . the organization has successfully bred a tamaraw , nicknamed kali           act 9147 , or the wildlife resources conservation and protection act was enacted to protect the tamaraw and other endemic species from hunting and sale . during the 1970s , a gene pool was established to preserve the tamaraw s numbers . however , the project was not successful as only one offspring , named kali , was produced . as of 2011 , kali is the only surviving animal in the gene pooling project . the project was also not improved as the protected areas and wildlife bureau shown that the tamaraws were already breeding in the wild . cloning was not implemented for conservation as the department of environment and natural resource argued that such measures would diminish the genetic diversity of the species . a small subpopulation of tamaraw has been found within the confines of the mt . iglit game refuge and bird sanctuary on the same island of mindoro . as of may 2007 ,   bubalus mindorensis   is on   appendix i   of the convention on international trade in endangered species where it has been since the species was           . with the listing , cites recognizes the species as critically endangered and threatened with extinction . thus , international commercial trade in the species or any derivatives of which , such as the meat , horns or flesh is considered illegal . while commercial trade in the species is prohibited , exchange for non-commercial reasons such as scientific research is allowed .  importance to humans   economical and commercial value  while not as heavily exploited as other large , endangered mammals , the tamaraw population on mindoro was subject to some harvesting pressure from subsistence hunters before conservation efforts were spurred towards the latter half of the 20th century . the iucn has described this as still ongoing in their 2006 red list report .  in philippine culture  though the national animal of the philippines is the carabao , in the 1970s toyota motors , through the defunct local company delta motors , built the tamaraw auv . because of its ruggedness and simplicity of design , some examples still survive to this day , copied by multinational companies ford           manufacturers to this day . because it is an asian utility vehicle , it shares its design with the kijang , the indonesian version . automobile maker toyota once held a franchise in the philippine basketball association , naming its team the toyota tamaraws . during the wake of the asian utility popularity in the 1990s , toyota motors philippines released an asian utility vehicle ) called tamaraw fx in the philippines , an evolution of the tamaraw auv . it was widely patronized by taxi operators and was immediately turned into a staple mode of transportation much like a cross of the taxi and the jeepney . the fx eventually evolved into the revo . the tamaraw is also the mascot of the varsity teams of the far eastern university in the university athletic association of the philippines , and of the toyota tamaraws of the philippine basketball association . the tamaraw falls in barangay villaflor , puerto galera were also named after the bovine .

  paphiopedilum   , often called the venus slipper , is a genus of the lady slipper orchid subfamily   cypripedioideae   of the flowering plant family orchidaceae . the genus comprises some 80 accepted taxa including several natural hybrids . the genus is native to southeast asia , the indian subcontinent , southern china , new guinea and the solomon and bismarck islands . the species and their hybrids are extensively cultivated , and are known as either paphiopedilums , or by the abbreviation paphs in horticulture . the type species of this genus is   paphiopedilum insigne   .  description    paphiopedilum   species naturally occur among humus layers as terrestrials on the forest floor , while a few are true epiphytes and some are lithophytes . these sympodial orchids lack pseudobulbs . instead , they grow robust shoots , each with several leaves ; some are hemicryptophytes . the leaves can be short and rounded or long and narrow , and typically have a mottled pattern . when older shoots die , newer ones take           is fully grown , producing a raceme between the fleshy , succulent leaves . the roots are thick and fleshy . potted plants form a tight lump of roots that , when untangled , can be up to 1 m long . members of this genus are considered highly collectible by orchid fanciers due to the curious and unusual form of their flowers . along with   cypripedium   ,   mexipedium   ,   phragmipedium   and   selenipedium   , the genus is a member of the subfamily cypripedioideae , commonly referred to as the ladys-slippers or slipper orchids due to the unusual shape of the pouch-like labellum of the flower . the pouch traps insects seeking nectar , and to leave again they have to climb up past the staminode , behind which they collect or deposit pollinia . the orchid , despite several attempts to clone by tissue culture , has never been successfully cloned , for unknown reasons . this means every plant is unique .  in horticulture  the paphiopedilums are among the most widely cultivated           being discovered every now and then ; for example the golden slipper orchid , discovered in 1979 and described in 1982 , amazed growers of orchids by the extraordinary beauty of its golden flowers . in addition , growers have bred thousands of interspecific hybrids and registered them with the royal horticultural society in london over the years . these orchids are relatively easy to grow indoors , as long as conditions that mimic their natural habitats are created . most species thrive in moderate to high humidity , moderate temperatures ranging from 13 to 35 degrees celsius and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 lux . modern hybrids are typically easier to grow in artificial conditions than their parent species .  taxonomy and systematics  the genus name   paphiopedilum   was established by ernst hugo heinrich pfitzer in 1886 ; it is derived from paphos and           , no paphiopedilum occurs on cyprus &amp;ndash ; at least not as the genus is understood today . but it was long mixed up with its holarctic relative   cypripedium   , which indeed grows in the mediterranean region .   paphiopedilum   was finally decided to be a valid taxon in 1959 , but its use has become restricted to eastern asian species in our time .  subdivisions  the genus   paphiopedilum   has been divided into several subgenera , and then further into sections and subsections : * subgenus   parvisepalum   * subgenus   brachypetalum   * subgenus   polyantha   ** section   mastigopetalum   ** section   polyantha   ** section   mystropetalum   ** section   stictopetalum   ** section   paphiopedilum   ** section   ceratopetalum   ** section   cymatopetalum   ** section   thiopetalum   * subgenus   sigmatopetalum   ** section   spathopetalum   *** subsection             ** section   blepharopetalum   ** section   mastersianum   ** section   punctatum   ** section   barbata   *** subsection   lorapetalum   *** subsection   chloroneura   ** section   planipetalum   ** section   venustum   * subgenus   cochlopetalum    selected species  there are more than 550 taxa in this genus , including some 80 valid species . some notable species and their natural hybrids are listed here , together with some assorted varieties and forms : *   paphiopedilum acmodontum   *   paphiopedilum adductum   *   paphiopedilum affine   *   paphiopedilum appletonianum   *   paphiopedilum areeanum   *   paphiopedilum argus   *   paphiopedilum barbigerum   *   paphiopedilum bellatulum   &amp;ndash ;

the ashvamedha was one of the most important royal rituals of vedic religion , described in detail in the yajurveda . the rigveda does have descriptions of horse sacrifice , notably in hymns rv 1.162-163 , but does not allude to the full ritual according to the yajurveda . as per brahma vaivarta purana , on the next morning , the priests raise the queen from the place where she has spent the night with the horse . with the   dadhikra   verse , a verse used as a purifier after obscene language . the three queens with a hundred golden , silver and copper needles indicate the lines on the horse s body along which it will be dissected . the horse is dissected , and its flesh roasted           and personified concepts with utterances of   svaha   all-hail . the   ashvastuti   or eulogy of the horse follows , concluding with : : may this steed bring us all-sustaining riches , wealth in good kine , good horses , manly offspring : freedom from sin may aditi vouchsafe us : the steed with our oblations gain us lordship ! the priests performing the sacrifice were recompensed with a part of the booty won during the wandering of the horse . according to a commentator , the spoils from the east were given to the hotar , while the adhvaryu a maiden and the sacrificer s fourth wife . the shatapatha brahmana emphasizes the royal nature of the ashvamedha : : verily , the asvamedha means royal sway : it is after royal sway that these strive who guard the horse . it repeatedly states that the asvamedha is everything the ashvamedha           soma sacrifice and incorporates other important sacrifices . the ashvamedha is intended to secure prosperity for the kingdom and its subjects . it is a bloody sacrifice in which the domestic animals are killed and non-domestic animals are set free . it ends with a further sacrifice of twenty one cows . gifts are then given to the officers , culminating in the gift to the priests of the four wives of the king or their attendants . . the human sacrifice , the purushamedha , followed a similar format , but included a man with the animals to be sacrificed . the price of the man was set at one thousand cows and a hundred horses . like the horse , the man chosen for sacrifice was allowed to wander for a year . once he had been killed , the queen lay with his corpse . the ashvamedha celebrated the king as king of the whole world , not as king of a part of the world that constituted his kingdom . the stature of a king was not related to a particular part of the world that might           the horse was considered a noble animal and was associated with the military class . when the asvamedha has been performed in historical times , it has been more to demonstrate vedic orthodoxy than for genuinely religious reasons . the laws of manu refer to the ashvamedha :  the man who offers a horse-sacrifice every day for a hundred years , and the man who does not eat meat , the two of them reap the same fruit of good deeds .   known historical performances  pusyamitra sunga is said to have performed the ashvamedha rite after he toppled mauryan rule in 185 bc . a historically documented performance of the ashvamedha is during the reign of samudragupta i , the father of chandragupta ii . special coins were minted to commemorate the ashvamedha and the king took on the title of   maharajadhiraja   after successful completion of the sacrifice . there were a few later performances , one by raja of kannauj jai chandra rathod in the 12th century , unsuccessfully , as prithviraj chauhan thwarted his           known instance seems to be in 1716 ce , by jai singh ii of amber , of jaipur.  performances in hindu epics  performances of the ashvamedha feature in the epics ramayana and mahabharata . in the mahabharata , the sacrifice is performed by yudhishtira , his brothers guarding the horse as it roamed into neighbouring kingdoms . arjuna defeats all challengers . the mahabharata says that the ashvamedha as performed by yudhishtira adhered to the letter of the vedic prescriptions . after the horse was cut into parts , draupadi had to sit beside the parts of the horse . in the ramayana , rama s father dasharatha performs the ashvamedha , which is described in the   bala kanda   of the poem . the ramayana provides far more detail than the mahabharata . the ritual take place for three days preceded by sage rishyasringa and vasista . again it is stated that the ritual was performed in strict compliance with vedic prescriptions . dasaratha s chief wife kausalya circumambulates           . then queen kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird . 1-14-34 . the fat of the sacrificed horse is then burnt in ritual fire and after that the remaining parts of the body with spoons made out of plaksha tree branches . at the conclusion of the ritual dasharatha symbolically offers his other wives to the presiding priests , who return them in exchange for expensive gifts . the four sides of the yagna altar is also donated to priests who had done the ritual and it is exchanged by them for gold , silver , cows and other gifts . in the shanti parva of the mahabharata , the sacrifice is performed by king vasu uparichara . by the king s decree , no animals were slain during the yagna , and the only offerings that were made were products of the wilderness . some historians believe that the bala kanda and uttara kanda were latter interpolations to the authentic form of the ramayana , due to references to greek , parthians and sakas            indo-european comparison  many indo-european branches show evidence for horse sacrifice , and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a proto-indo-european ritual . the ashvamedha is the clearest evidence preserved , but vestiges from latin and celtic traditions allow the reconstruction of a few common attributes . the gaulish personal name   epomeduos   is from   *ekwo-medhu-   horse+mead , while   ashvamedha   is either from   *ekwo-mad-dho-   horse+drunk or   *ekwo-mey-dho-   horse+strength . the reconstructed myth involves the coupling of a king with a divine mare which produced the divine twins . some scholars , including edgar polom , regard the reconstruction of a proto-indo-european ritual as unjustified due to the difference between the attested traditions .  vedanta and puranas  the brhadaranyaka upanishad has a creation myth where     death takes the shape of a horse , and includes an           he became a horse , because it swelled , and was fit for sacrifice ; and this is why the horse-sacrifice is called ashva-medha ... therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to prajapati , to all the deities . verily the shining sun   ye tapati   is the asvamedha , and his body is the year ; agni is the sacrificial fire , and these worlds are his bodies . these two are the sacrificial fire and the asvamedha-sacrifice , and they are again one deity , viz. death . the upanishads describe ascetic austerities as an inner ashvamedha , as opposed to the outer royal ritual performed in the physical world , in keeping with the general tendency of vedanta to move away from priestly ritual towards spiritual introspection ; verse 6 of the avadhuta upanishad has : : through extreme devotion               . that is the greatest sacrifice     and the greatest meditation     . according to the brahma vaivarta purana , the ashvamedha is one of five rites forbidden in the kali yuga.  in hindu revivalism  in the arya samaj reform movement of dayananda sarasvati , the ashvamedha is considered an allegory or a ritual to get connected to the inner sun dayananda in his   introduction to the commentary on the vedas   rejected the classical commentaries of the vedas by sayana , mahidhara and uvata as medieval corruptions opposed to the real meaning of the vedas in order to arrive at an entirely symbolic interpretation of the ritual : an empire is like a horse and the subjects like other inferior animals . thus , vsm 23.22 , literally he beats on the vulva , the penis oozes repeatedly in the receptacle is interpreted           but in terms of the king and his subjects , the subjects are called   gabha   , kingly power called   pasa   . this interpretation is apparently based on a verse from shatapatha brahmana . following dayananda , arya samaj disputes the very existence of the pre-vedantic ritual ; thus swami satya prakash saraswati claims that : the word in the sense of the horse sacrifice does not occur in the samhitas ... in the terms of cosmic analogy ,   ashva   is the sun . in respect to the   adhyatma paksha   , the   prajapati-agni   , or the   purusha   , the creator , is the   ashva   ; he is the same as the varuna , the most supreme . the word   medha   stands for homage ; it later on became synonymous with oblations in rituology , since oblations are offered , dedicated to the one whom we pay           mean  slaughter  or  sacrifice  .   the critical and cultural study of the shatapatha brahmana by swami satya prakash saraswati   , p. 415 ; 476 arguing that the animals listed as sacrificial victims are just as symbolic as the list of human victims listed in the purushamedha. . other commentators accept the existence of the sacrifice but reject the notion that the queen lay down with the dead horse . thus subhash kak in a blog posting suggests that the queen lay down with a toy horse rather than with the slaughtered stallion , due to presence of the word   ashvaka   , similar to   shivaka   meaning idol or image of shiva all world gayatri pariwar since 1991 has organized performances of a modern version of the ashvamedha where a statue is used in place of a real horse , according to hinduism today with a million participants in chitrakoot , madhya pradesh on april 16 to 20 , 1994 . such           without killing it , the religious motivation being prayer for overcoming enemies , the facilitation of child welfare and development , and clearance of debt , entirely within the allegorical interpretation of the ritual , and with no actual sacrifice of any animal . swami dayananda saraswati rejected the classical commentaries of the vedas by sayana , mahidhara and uvata as medieval corruptions opposed to the real meaning of the vedas in order to arrive at an entirely symbolic interpretation of the ritual : an empire is like a horse and the subjects like other inferior animals . thus , vsm 23.22 , literally he beats on the vulva , the penis oozes repeatedly in the receptacle is interpreted not in terms of the horse and the queen , but in terms of the king and his subjects , the subjects are called   gabha   , kingly power called   pasa             this interpretation is apparently based on a verse from shatapatha brahmana . according to him , no horse was actually to be slaughtered in the ritual as per the yajurveda.  reception  the earliest recorded criticism of the ritual comes from the crvka , an atheistic school of indian philosophy that assumed various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference . a quotation of the crvka from madhavacharya s sarva-darsana-sangraha states : griffith omits verses vsm 23.20&amp;ndash ; 31 , protesting that they are not reproducible even in the semi-obscurity of a learned european language . a. b. keith s 1914 translation also omits verses . this part of the ritual offended the dalit reformer and framer of the indian constitution b. r. ambedkar and is frequently mentioned in his writings as an example of the perceived degradation of brahmanical culture . while others such has manohar l. varadpande , praised the ritual as social occasions of great magnitude . rick f. talbott writes that mircea           structure which both regenerated the entire cosmos and reestablished every social order during its performance .
pixies are mythical creatures of folklore , considered to be particularly concentrated in the high moorland areas around devon and cornwall , suggesting some celtic origin for the belief and name . akin to the irish and scottish aos s , pixies are believed to inhabit ancient underground ancestor sites such as stone circles , barrows , dolmens , ringfort or menhirs . in traditional regional lore , pixies are generally benign , mischievous , short of stature and attractively childlike ; they are fond of dancing and gather outdoors in huge numbers to dance or sometimes wrestle , through the night , demonstrating parallels with the cornish plen-an-gwary and breton fest noz folk celebrations originating in the medieval period . in modern times they are usually depicted with pointed ears , and often wearing a green outfit and pointed hat . sometimes their eyes are described as being pointed upwards at the temple ends . these , however , are victorian era conventions           use , the term can be synonymous with fairies or sprites . however , in folklore there is a traditional enmity , even war , between the two races .  etymology and origin  the origin of the name   pixie   is uncertain . some have speculated that it comes from the swedish dialectal   pyske   meaning   wee little fairy   . others , however , have disputed this , given there is no plausible case for nordic dialectical survivals in southwest britiain , and claiming instead that due to the cornish origin of the   piskie   that the term is more probably celtic in origin , though no direct ancestor of the word is known , however the term   pobel vean   is often used to refer to them collectively . very similar analogues exist in closely related irish and breton culture , although their common names are unrelated , even within areas of language survival there is a very high           name for pixie is   spriggan   this being the area of late survival of the cornish language where   spriggan   s are distinguished from pixies by their malevolent nature . closely associated with tin mining in cornwall are the subterranean ancestral knockers . pixie mythology is believed to pre-date christian presence in britain . in the christian era they were sometimes said to be the souls of children who had died un-baptised . these children would change their appearance to pixies once their clothing was placed in clay funeral pots used in their earthly lives as toys . by 1869 some were suggesting that the name pixie was a racial remnant of pictic tribes who used to paint and tattoo their skin blue , an attribute often given to pixies . this suggestion is still met in contemporary writing , but there is no proven connection and the etymological connection is doubtful . some 19th-century researchers made more general claims about pixie origins , or have connected them with the puck , a mythological creature sometimes described as a fairy ;           the advent of more modern fiction , pixie mythology was localised to britain . some have noted similarities to northern fairies , germanic and scandinavian elves , but pixies are distinguished from them by the myths and stories of devon and cornwall .  cornwall and devon  before the mid-19th century , pixies and fairies were taken seriously in much of cornwall and devon . books devoted to the homely beliefs of the peasantry are filled with incidents of pixie manifestations . some locales are named for the pixies associated with them . in devon , near challacombe , a group of rocks are named for the pixies said to dwell there . at trevose head in cornwall 600 pixies were said to have gathered dancing and laughing in a circle that had appeared upon the turf until one of their number , named omfra , lost his laugh . after searching amongst the barrows of the ancient kings of cornwall on st breock downs , he wades through the bottomless dozmary pool on bodmin moor until his laugh is restored by king arthur in the form of a chough           real beings persists . in the legends associated with dartmoor , pixies are said to disguise themselves as a bundle of rags to lure children into their play . the pixies of dartmoor are fond of music and dancing and for riding on dartmoor colts . these pixies are generally said to be helpful to normal humans , sometimes helping needy widows and others with housework . they are not completely benign however , as they have a reputation for misleading travellers . the queen of the cornish pixies is said to be joan the wad , and she is considered to be good luck or bring good luck . in devon , pixies are said to be invisibly small , and harmless or friendly to man . in some of the legends and historical accounts they are presented as having near-human stature . for instance , a member of the elford family in tavistock , devon , successfully hid from cromwells troops in a pixie house .           house , a natural cavern on sheep tor , is still accessible . at buckland st. mary , somerset , pixies and fairies are said to have battled each other . here the pixies were victorious and still visit the area , whilst the fairies are said to have left after their loss . by the early 19th century their contact with humans had diminished . in samuel drews 1824 book   cornwall   one finds the observation : the age of pixies , like that of chivalry , is gone . there is , perhaps , at present hardly a house they are reputed to visit . even the fields and lanes which they formerly frequented seem to be nearly forsaken . their music is rarely heard .  pixie day  pixie day is an old tradition which takes place annually in the east devon town of ottery st. mary in june . the day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the pixie s parlour . the pixie day legend originates from the early days of christianity ,           otteri , and commissioned a set of bells to come from wales , and to be escorted by monks on their journey . on hearing of this , the pixies were worried , as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land . so they cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to otteri to the road leading them to the cliff s edge at sidmouth . just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff , one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said god bless my soul and the spell was broken . the bells were then brought to otteri and installed . however , the pixies  spell was not completely broken ; each year on a day in june the pixies come out and capture the town s bell ringers and imprison them in pixies  parlour to be rescued by the vicar of ottery st. mary . this legend is re-enacted each year by the cub and brownie           pixies  parlour in the town square .  characteristics  pixies are variously described in folklore and fiction . they are often described as ill-clothed or naked . in 1890 , william crossing noted a pixie s preference for bits of finery : indeed , a sort of weakness for finery exists among them , and a piece of ribbon appears to be .. highly prized by them . some pixies are said to steal children or to lead travellers astray . this seems to be a cross-over from fairy mythology and not originally attached to pixies ; in 1850 , thomas keightley observed that much of devon pixie mythology may have originated from fairy myth . pixies are said to reward consideration and punish neglect on the part of larger humans , for which keightley gives examples . by their presence they bring blessings to those who are fond of them . pixies are drawn to horses , riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses           caves of the ocean , the hidden sources of the streams and the recesses of the land . some find pixies to have a human origin or to partake of human nature , in distinction to fairies whose mythology is traced to immaterial and malignant spirit forces . in some discussions pixies are presented as wingless , pygmy-like creatures , however this is probably a later accretion to the mythology . one british scholar stated his belief that pixies were evidently a smaller race , and , from the greater obscurity of the .. tales about them , i believe them to have been an earlier race .  literary interpretations  many victorian era poets saw them as magical beings . an example is samuel minturn peck : in his poem   the pixies   he writes : : t is said their forms are tiny , yet : : all human ills they can subdue , : or with a wand or amulet : : can win a maidens heart for you ; : and many a blessing know to stew : : to make to wedlock           : : the pixies are abroad tonight . the late 19th century english poet nora chesson summarised pixie mythology fairly well in a poem entitled   the pixies   . she gathered all the speculations and myths into verse : : have eer you seen the pixies , the fold not blest or banned ? : they walk upon the waters ; they sail upon the land , : they make the green grass greener whereer their footsteps fall , : the wildest hind in the forest comes at their call . : they steal from bolted linneys , they milk the key at grass , : the maids are kissed a-milking , and no one hears them pass . : they flit from byre to stable and ride unbroken foals , : they seek out human lovers to win them souls . : the pixies know no sorrow , the pixies feel no fear , : they take no care for harvest or seedtime of the year ; : age lays no finger on them , the reaper time goes by : the pixies , they who change           pixies though they love us , behold us pass away , : and are not sad for flowers they gathered yesterday , : to-day has crimson foxglove . : if purple hose-in-hose withered last night : to-morrow will have its rose . she touches on all the essentials , including even more modern accretions . pixies are in-between , not cursed by god or especially blessed . they do the unexpected , they bless the land , and are forest creatures whom other wild creatures find alluring and non-threatening . they love humans , taking some for mates , and are nearly ageless . they are winged , flitting from place to place . the pixie day tradition in samuel taylor coleridges hometown of ottery st mary in east devon was the inspiration for his poem   song of the pixies   . the victorian era writer mary elizabeth whitcombe divided pixies into tribes according to personality and deeds . anna eliza bray suggested that pixies and fairies were distinct species .  modern fiction  pixies serve as helpers of santa claus in l. frank baum s 1902             and his 1904 short story   a kidnapped santa claus   . they reside in the forest of burzee . in michael buckley s   the sisters grimm   series , pixies are described as small orange-glowing creatures that resemble fireflies and are controlled by fairies such as puck by the use of a small wooden flute . enid blyton wrote a number of children s books with pixies as featured characters . one employee of the bbc even criticised her stories .. have nt much literary value . there is rather a lot of the pink-winky-doodle-doodle dum-dumm type of name in the original tales . in holly black s and tony diterlizzi s spiderwick chronicles , pixies are green-skinned , human-sized fairies with shimmering wings . they have a command of glamour and a type of power to charm or seduce others . holly black has also written a book called   tithe   in which the main character is a pixie . in eoin colfer s   artemis fowl             species that have been driven underground by humans and the pollution they have caused on earth . opal koboi is the megalomaniac genius pixie of   artemis fowl : the opal deception   . colfer describes characteristics of pixies as having abnormally childish features and larger heads than other types of fairies , with large but vulnerable brains . they are also prone to headaches and , particularly in the case of opal koboi , violent mood swings and temper tantrums . koboi is the perfect example of their genius turned to madness . in terry pratchett s   discworld   novels   the wee free men   and   a hat full of sky   , a race of kilt-wearing fairies , warriors named the nac mac feegle , call themselves pictsies . in j. k. rowling s   harry potter and the chamber of secrets   , gilderoy lockhart releases a cage of cornish blue pixies into the classroom in an inept effort to           against the dark arts class . rowling s version of pixies are about 8 inches tall , electric blue in colour , and are wildly rambunctious tricksters . in kim harrison s rachel morgan series , rachel , a witch , works closely with jenks , a pixie , to track down the missing , save various creatures , retrieve stolen objects , and defend the defenceless , etc . jenks , his wife , and large family live in , tend , and protect rachel s garden . british rock band alien stash tin included a short novelty song called bingo the magic pixie as a bonus track on their 2007 debut album . bingo is described as living alone and making mushroom wine which he shares with his friends .   need   , a series of novels by carrie jones , follows a struggle against malicious pixies in an urban fantasy setting . several characters in the marvel comics universe have been called pixie . neil gaiman told tales of pixies in his novel   american gods   . ivy , the heroine of           is a cornish piskey who lives with her clan in an abandoned tin mine .  animation  in the disney film ,   peter pan   , tinker bell is described as a pixie , although , in the j.m. barrie play on which the film is based , she is actually a fairy . in the disney versions she always uses pixie dust , rather than the fairy dust in the play . in barrie s original play , tinker bell is traditionally staged just as a flying point of light beamed from offstage . disney continues to use the terms pixie and fairy interchangeably for tinker bell , and associated spin-offs . in   the fairly oddparents   , the pixies are recurring villains who are dull , wear grey suits , speak in monotone voices , wear pointy caps and , unlike the fairies , treat magic like a business . instead of wands , they carry cellphones . this is due to them being named after pixels . the head pixie , and the other male pixies           are not seen . pixies also make an appearance in the cartoon winx club . in this version , it seems that almost all pixies are females , and while they do use their magic as a carrier based on their talents , these pixies are more colourful , more fun-loving , and more voice-variant in spite of having the same toddler-like , high-pitched accent from their natural toy-like size . also , the winx club pixies are friends with fairies . in fact , each pixie bonds at first sight with her fairy of fate and helps her any way their talent would allow and that fairy , in turn , protects her pixie .

:   for the drawing style of anime and manga , see super deformed .   in nuclear physics a superdeformed nucleus is a nucleus that is very far from spherical , forming an ellipsoid with axes in ratios of approximately 2:1:1 . normal deformation is approximately 1.3:1:1 . only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states . the first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers , low-spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series . the strong force decays much faster than the coulomb force , which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2.5 femtometers apart . for this reason , these elements undergo spontaneous fission . in the late 1980s , high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table . specific elements include ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , osmium , iridium , platinum , gold , and mercury . the existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors , which together lower their energies , and make them stable minima of energy as a           described by the liquid drop model . the liquid drop s energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation , due to the surface tension term . however , the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the coulomb repulsion and also , in the case of high-spin states , because of the increased moment of inertia . modulating this macroscopic behavior , the microscopic shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical magic numbers . for nuclei near these magic numbers , the shell correction creates a second minimum in the energy as a function of deformation . even more deformed states are called hyperdeformed.

  unsafe at any speed : the designed-in dangers of the american automobile   by ralph nader , published in 1965 , is a book accusing car manufacturers of resistance to the introduction of safety features , like seat belts , and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety . it was a pioneering work , openly polemical but containing substantial references and material from industry insiders . it made nader a household name .  theme    unsafe at any speed   is often characterized as the book about the corvair , though only one of the book s eight chapters covers the corvair . the theme of tire pressures chosen for comfort rather than safety is recurrent , and the main theme throughout is the charge that the automobile industry evaded well-founded and technically informed criticism .  organization and content  each of the book s chapters covers a different aspect of automotive safety :  the sporty corvair  the subject for which the book is probably most widely known , the rear-engined chevrolet corvair , is           this relates to the first models that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances . in substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar , corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer s recommended tolerances . the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential , and if one inflated the tires equally , as was standard practice for all other cars at the time , the result was a dangerous oversteer . despite the fact that proper tire pressures was more critical than for contemporaneous designs , this was not clearly stated to chevrolet salespeople and corvair owners . according to the standards laid down by the relevant industry body , the tire and rim association , the pressures also rendered the front tires overloaded when there were two or more passengers on board . an unadvertised at-cost option included upgraded springs and dampers , front anti-roll bars           also available , such as the empi camber compensator , for the knowledgeable owner . the suspension was modified for 1964 models , with inclusion of a standard front anti-roll bar and a transverse-mounted rear spring . in 1965 , the totally redesigned four-link , fully independent rear suspension maintained a constant camber angle at the wheels . corvairs from 1965 were not prone to the formerly characteristic tuck-under crashes . george caramagna , the chevrolet suspension mechanic was vital to this issue . the missing bar had caused many crashes and it was caramagna who precipitated the whole controversy by staying his ground on the issue .  disaster deferred  chapter 2 levels criticism on auto design elements such as instrument panels and dashboards that were often brightly finished with chrome and glossy enamels which could reflect sunlight or the headlights of oncoming motor vehicles into the driver s eyes . this problem , according to nader , was well known by persons           it . apart from some of the examples given in the corvair chapter , nader offers much about the gear shift quadrants on earlier cars fitted with automatic transmissions . several examples are given of persons accidentally being run over , or cars that turned into runaways because the driver operating the vehicle at the time of the accident was not familiar with its shift pattern and would shift into reverse when intending to shift to park . nader makes an appeal to the auto industry to standardize gearshift patterns between makes and models as a safety issue . early automatic transmissions , including gm s hydra-matic , packard s ultramatic , and borg warner s automatic used by a number of independent manufacturers used a pattern of p n d l r , which put reverse at the bottom of the quadrant , next to low which was contrary to the pattern used by other manufacturers . drivers used to moving the shift lever all the way down for low gear would accidentally select r and would unexpectedly move the car backwards . in addition           push-button selector to choose gear ranges . ford was the first to use the p r n d l pattern , which separated reverse from forward ranges by neutral . eventually this pattern became the standard for all automatic-shift cars . chevrolet s powerglide , at least as seen on the corvair , used a r n d l pattern , which separated the reverse from the drive gears by neutral in the ideal way , but which had no p selection , relying instead on the process used with a manual transmission of the driver selecting n and using a separate parking brake when parking . chapter 2 also exposes problems in workmanship and the failure of companies to honor warranties.  the second collision  chapter 3 documents the history of crash science focusing on the effect on the body as it collides with the interior of the car as the car hits another object . nader argues that much knowledge was available to designers by the early 1960s but it was largely ignored within the           steering assembly , instrument panel , windshield , passenger restraint , and the passenger compartment . due to this , the nader bolt was installed to reinforce the door and suicide doors were discontinued because of a lack of door strength .  the power to pollute  chapter 4 documents the automobile s impact on air pollution and its contribution to smog , with a particular focus on los angeles .  the engineers  chapter 5 is about detroit automotive engineers  general unwillingness to focus on road-safety improvements for fear of alienating the buyer or making cars too expensive . nader counters by pointing out that , at the time , annual styling changes added on average about $700 to the consumer cost of a new car . this compared to an average expenditure in safety by the automotive companies of about twenty-three cents per car .  the stylists  chapter 6 explores the excessive ornamentation that appeared on cars , particularly in the late 1950s , and the dominance of car           nader notes bumpers shaped like sled-runners and sloping grille work above the bumpers , which give the effect of  leaning into the wind  , increase .. the car s potential for exerting down-and-under pressures on the pedestrian . see current practice at pedestrian safety through vehicle design .  the traffic safety establishment  subtitled damn the driver and spare the car , chapter 7 discusses the way the blame for accidents and fatalities was placed on the driver . the book claims that the road safety mantra called the three e s was created by the industry in the 1920s to distract attention from the real problems of vehicle safety , such as the fact that some were sold with tires that could not bear the weight of a fully loaded vehicle . to the industry , he said enforcement and education meant the driver , while engineering was all about the road . as late as 1965 , he noted , 320 million federal dollars were allocated to highway beautification , while just $500,000 was dedicated to highway safety .           the concluding chapter , suggests that the automotive industry should be forced by government to pay greater attention to safety in the face of mounting evidence about preventable death and injury .  government response  the book has continuing relevance : it addressed what nader perceived as the political meddling of the car industry to oppose new safety features , which parallels the debates in the 1990s over the mandatory fitting of air bags in the united states , and industry efforts by the acea to delay the introduction of crash tests to assess vehicle-front pedestrian protection in the european union .  industry response  nader claims that gm responded to his criticism of the corvair by trying to destroy nader s image and to silence him . it conducted a series of interviews with acquaintances of the plaintiff , questioning them about , and casting aspersions upon his political , social , racial and religious views ; his integrity ; his sexual proclivities and inclinations ; and his personal habits ; kept him under surveillance in public places for an unreasonable length           accosted by girls for the purpose of entrapping him into illicit relationships ; made threatening , harassing and obnoxious telephone calls to him ; tapped his telephone and eavesdropped , by means of mechanical and electronic equipment , on his private conversations with others ; and conducted a continuing and harassing investigation of him . on march 22 , 1966 , gm president james roche was forced to appear before a united states senate subcommittee , and to apologize to nader for the company s campaign of harassment and intimidation . nader later successfully sued gm for excessive invasion of privacy . it was the money from this case that allowed him to lobby for consumer rights , leading to the creation of the u.s. environmental protection agency and the clean air act , among other things . former gm executive john delorean asserted in   on a clear day you can see general motors   that nader s criticisms were valid . former ford and chrysler president lee iacocca said the corvair was  unsafe              iacocca : an autobiography   .  criticisms of the book  the u.s. department of transportation issued a press release dated august 12 , 1972 , setting out the findings of 1971 nhtsa testing -- after the corvair had been out of production for more than three years . the national highway traffic safety administration had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 corvair and four contemporary cars , a ford falcon , plymouth valiant , volkswagen beetle , renault dauphine -- along with a second generation corvair with revised suspension design . the subsequent 143-page report reviewed a series of actual handling tests designed to evaluate the handling and stability under extreme conditions ; a review of national accident data compiled by insurance companies and traffic authorities for the cars in the test -- and a review of related general motors/chevrolet internal letters , memos , tests , reports , etc. regarding the corvair s handling . nhtsa went on to contract a three person           and competency of their tests . this review panel then issued its own 24-page report , which concluded that the 1960-63 corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960-63 corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover , and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic . social scientist thomas sowell argued in   the vision of the anointed   that nader was ignorant and dismissive of the trade-off between safety and affordability . according to sowell , nader also did not pay much attention to the fact that motor vehicle death rates per 100 million passenger miles fell over the years from 17.9 in 1925 to 5.5 in 1965 . journalist david e. davis , in a 2009 article in   automobile magazine   , criticized nader for purportedly focusing on the corvair while ignoring other contemporary vehicles with swing-axle rear suspensions , including cars from porsche ,           center for auto safety had published a book critical of the beetle . furthermore ,   motor trend   magazine has noted handling problems with the 50 s era mercedes 300sl gullwing . journalist timothy noah claimed the car was nt significantly more dangerous than other american cars of its time , citing both a government report and an independent report : .. the car was not , in fact , appreciably less safe than a number of other cars on the market in 2005 , the book was named by conservative publication   human events   as an honorable mention on its list of the most harmful books of the 19th and 20th centuries .
birthplace = deathplace = london , england sir charles spencer , 3rd earl of sunderland kg pc , known as lord spencer from 1688 to 1702 , was an english statesman from the spencer family . he served as lord lieutenant of ireland , lord privy seal , lord president of the council and first lord of the treasury .  early life  he was the second son of robert spencer , 2nd earl of sunderland and anne digby , daughter of george digby , 2nd earl of bristol . on the death of his elder brother robert in paris in september 1688 , he became heir to the peerage . called by john evelyn a youth of extraordinary hopes , he completed his education at utrecht , and in 1695 entered the house of commons as member for tiverton . in the same year , he married arabella , daughter of henry cavendish , 2nd duke of newcastle ; she died in 1698 and           john churchill , 1st duke of marlborough and sarah churchill , duchess of marlborough . this was an important alliance for sunderland and for his descendants ; through it he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of marlborough came to the spencers . in 1698 he plunged his family into scandal when his brother-in-law donogh maccarthy , 4th earl of clancarty , who had been imprisoned in the tower of london for his support for james ii and later escaped , was reconciled with his long-estranged wife , charles  sister elizabeth . charles , alerted by his servants , had clancarty arrested . the result was a public uproar which gravely embarrassed his parents . william iii treated the matter as a trifle , wondering why everyone teased him about that little spark clancarty , and gave the couple permission to settle in altona , hamburg . his father s biographer comments that the affair did not show charles in a good light either as man or brother .  career  having succeeded to the peerage in 1702 , sunderland was one of the commissioners for           , he was sent to vienna as envoy extraordinary . although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to queen anne by opposing the grant to her husband , prince george , through the influence of marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as secretary of state for the southern department , taking office in december 1706 . from 1708 to 1710 , he was one of the five whigs collectively called the   junto   , who dominated the government , but he had many enemies , the queen still disliked him , and in june 1710 , he was dismissed . anne offered him a pension of 3000 a year , but this he refused , saying if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it . when marlborough protested about the dismissal , the queen inquired sarcastically whether the peace of europe must depend on it ? she added that sunderland was universally unpopular , which , though a prejudiced view , was probably true enough . sunderland continued to take part in public life           hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen . he made the acquaintance of george i in 1706 , but when the elector became king , sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of lord lieutenant of ireland . in august 1715 , he joined the cabinet as lord privy seal . after a visit to george i in hanover , he secured in april 1717 the position of secretary of state for the northern department . this he retained until march 1718 , when he became first lord of the treasury , holding also the post of lord president of the council . he was now effectively the prime minister . sunderland was especially interested in the proposed peerage bill , a measure designed to limit the number of members of the house of lords , but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of sir robert walpole . in 1719 he was one of the main subscribers in the royal academy of music , a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage . the bursting of the           had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720 , therefore public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of walpole that he was acquitted by the house of commons , when the matter was investigated . in april 1721 , he resigned his offices , but he retained his influence with george i until his death on 19 april 1722 . sunderland inherited his father s passion for intrigue , while his manners were repelling , but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind . from his early years he had a great love of books , and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at althorp , which in 1703 was described as the finest in europe . in 1749 part of it was removed to blenheim palace . sunderland s second wife died in april 1716 , after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time . in 1717 , he married an irish lady of fortune , judith tichborne , daughter           tichborne , 1st baron ferrard , and elizabeth gibbs . she later married sir robert sutton . in 1722 sunderland was implicated in what became known as the atterbury plot , to restore the house of stuart , and his death was one of the factors which brought the plot to light . the town of sunderland , massachusetts , was named in his honor in november of 1718 , just after he became lord president of the council .  children  his first wife was arabella cavendish , daughter of henry cavendish , 2nd duke of newcastle . they had a single daughter : *frances spencer , married henry howard , 4th earl of carlisle . his second wife was lady anne churchill . they had five children : *robert spencer , succeeded his father as 4th earl of sunderland *anne spencer , married william bateman , 1st viscount bateman . *charles spencer , succeeded his           aunt , henrietta godolphin , 2nd duchess of marlborough , as 3rd duke of marlborough . *john spencer , father of john spencer , 1st earl spencer . *diana spencer , married john russell , 4th duke of bedford . his third wife was judith tichborne . they had three children who all predeceased lord sunderland .

**6;175940;br type=self-propelled howitzer weight=30.9 tonnes the su-122 was a soviet self-propelled howitzer or assault gun used during world war ii . the number 122 in the designation represents the caliber of the main armamenta 122 mm m-30s howitzer . the chassis was that of the t-34.  development history  soviet high command became interested in assault guns following the success of german sturmgeschutz iii spgs . assault guns had some advantages over tanks with turrets . the lack of a turret made them cheaper to produce . they could be built with a larger fighting compartment and could be fitted with bigger and more powerful weapons on a given chassis . however , assault guns could aim their cannons in high degree only by turning the entire vehicle , and were thus less suited for close combat than tanks with turrets . in april 1942 , design bureaus were asked to develop several assault guns with various armament : 76.2 mm zis-3 divisional field guns and 122 mm m-30 howitzers for infantry           enemy strongholds . a prototype assault gun , armed with the 122 mm howitzer and built on the german sturmgeschtz iii chassis was developed designated sg-122 . only 10 of these were completed . production was halted when the vehicle was found to be hard to maintain and judged to be unsuccessful . simultaneously , a spg based on the t-34 medium tank was also developed . initially the t-34 s chassis was selected for the 76.2 mm f-34 gun . this vehicle , the u-34 , was created in summer 1942 at the design bureau of uztm by n. w. kurin and g. f. ksjunin . it was a tank destroyer with the same armament as the t-34 , but because of the absence of a turret , the vehicle was 70 cm lower , had thicker armour , and was 2 tonnes lighter . it did not enter production . uztm then worked on combining features of the u-34 and the sg-122 . initial design work was completed between july and august 1942 . the project emphasized minimizing modifications to the platform           superstructure , engine and transmission as the u-34 and was armed with a new 122 mm m-30s howitzer from f. f. pietrow s design bureau . this vehicle also used the same gun bed cover and mountings as the sg-122 , to keep costs low and simplify production . it had 45 mm thick frontal armour . the m-30s howitzer could be elevated or depressed between 3 and +26 and had 10 of traverse . the five-man crew consisted of a driver , gunner , commander and two loaders . on 25 november 1942 the first u-35 prototype was ready . trials ran from 30 november to 19 december 1942 , and uncovered various faults in the design including insufficient elevation , a flawed shell transfer mechanism , poor ventilation for the crew compartment and the fact that the commander had to assist in operating the gun which made him unable to successfully carry out his other duties . the u-35 entered service with the red army as the su-35 despite these faults . production su-122s were based on an improved prototype built after trials were           front armour to ease production , modified layout of the fighting compartment , fewer vision slots , and a periscope for the commander . the first production vehicles were completed before 1943.  production history  su-122 production began in december 1942 with 27 vehicles built that month . the original plan for production beyond that point was to produce 100 su-122s each month . production continued until the summer of 1944 , by which time a total of about 1,150 su-122s had been built .  service history  the first su-122s produced in december 1942 were sent to training centers and two new combat units , the 1433rd and 1434th self-propelled artillery regiments . initially , each of these mixed regiments consisted of two batteries with four su-122s each and four batteries with four su-76 tank destroyers each . each regiment had an additional su-76 tank destroyer as a command vehicle . it was planned to raise 30 self-propelled artillery regiments operating within armoured and mechanized corps . in january 1943 , the 1433rd and 1434th           leningrad as part of the 54th army . on 14 january they saw combat for the first time in smierdny region . after that it was decided su-122s should follow between 400 m and 600 m behind the attacking tanks ; sometimes this distance was shortened to between 200 m and 300 m . the use of su-76 tank destroyers together with su-122s proved unsuccessful . based on combat experience , the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was changed ; the new regimental organization consisted of two batteries of su-76 tank destroyers and three of su-122s , for a total of 20 spgs . in april the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was again changed . separate regiments were created for su-76 tank destroyers and su-122s . the medium self-propelled artillery regiment consisted of four batteries of four su-122s each . each regiment was also equipped with either an additional su-122 or a t-34 for the commander and a ba-64 armoured car . this organization remained in place until the beginning of 1944 when the su-122 started to be           and su-85 tank destroyers . the su-122 proved effective in its intended role of direct fire on strongholds . the massive concussion of the 122mm he round was reportedly enough to blow the turret off even a tiger i if a direct hit was scored at close range , although longer range penetration against heavier german armor remained poor , a trait shared with the larger 152mm howitzers . the new bp-460a heat projectile was introduced in may 1943 ; however its primitive warhead design was only minimally more effective than brute concussive effects of the old he shell at close range . at least one su-122 was captured by the german army . a small number of su-122s survived the war . currently , only one example remains , on display in the kubinka tank museum .  variants  the su-122 had no variants that went into mass production . the t-34 chassis of the su-122 was further adapted as part of the later su-85 self-propelled gun . towards the end of the production run , a prototype su-122 was built with the same ball mantlet as the su-85           as the su-122 was being mass-produced , its design was being refined primarily with an eye to reduce production costs . the m-30s armament proved poorly suited for purpose , in spite of its prior recommendation by the gau rkka artillery committee . the howitzer took a lot of space and required both commander and gunner to operate it in order to fire . because of this , in january 1943 work started on fitting the su-122 with a different howitzer . the prototype su-122m was built in april 1943 . it featured a bigger fighting compartment as well as an individual driver s hatch . the m-30s howitzer , mounted on the floor of the vehicle , was replaced by the more modern d-11 howitzer . however , the su-122m was not put into production due to a decision to proceed with the su-85 instead .  su-122-iii  another attempt to create an improved su-122 replacement took a su-85 chassis and paired it with the 122-mm d-6 howitzer , which was lighter and smaller than the u-11 howitzer . this was unsuccessful           mechanism and its poor anti-tank capabilities . subsequent wartime design work on 122 mm self-propelled howitzers was cancelled .

franois cabarrus or francisco cabarrs lalanne ,   conde   de cabarrs was a french adventurer and spanish financier .  life   early life  he was born in bayonne , france , where his father , dominique cabarrus fourcade was a merchant and shipbuilder , linked to a saga of basque sea-captains , whalers and adventurers , who settled in capbreton , coming from the navarre region of spain . there is even a legend in capbreton , that a certain captain cabarrus or gabarrus led a basque whaling expedition to the shores of present-day nova scotia in canada in the year 1392 . francois was sent to study in toulouse but was recalled to bayonne by his family due to certain amorous adventures and was sent by his father to spain to practice with one of his business correspondents , named galabert . he not only learned the business , but also fell           employer s daughter . they settled in the town of carabanchel alto near madrid , where maria antonia s grandfather had a soap factory . their mansion in carabanchel was named maison st. pierre and many years later this mansion and the lands surrounding it were incorporated into the manor lands of the count of montijo . however , he soon began to take an active interest in public matters of the court in nearby madrid . the age of enlightenment had reached madrid , and king charles iii , was favourable to reforms advocated by a circle of politicians , including gaspar melchor de jovellanos , count campomanes , count floridablanca , pedro pablo abarca de bolea . among these cabarrus became conspicuous , especially in finance .  reforms and disgrace  he originated a bank , the   banco de san carlos   - which is the precursor of today s bank of spain , a company to trade with the south american colonies and with asia through           and an agricultural and hydraulic project known as the   canal de cabarrus   which is the origin of today s canal de isabel ii , supplying the water to the city of madrid , in the northeast of the madrid community - in the course of the jarama and within the municipal boundaries of the towns of torrelaguna , patones , torremocha del jarama , uceda and caraquiz . he was also involved in at least two other projects involved in the opening of navegable waterways which were never completed . one was the canal del guadarrama which was supposed to open a navegable waterway from madrid to the ocean linking several river basins from the guadarrama river up to the guadalquivir river and from there to the sea . the other project involved the widening of the llobregat river in the province of barcelona in catalua in order to open up the llobregat river valley to shipping and thus give impulse to the future industrial region of catalua with all the           on the lemaur brothers for the technical part of the projects . he also probably took note of the canal du midi and the canal del languedoc , built about a century earlier in france which had given the french such good results by making available a navegable waterway from the atlantic to the mediterranean without having to navigate around spain and avoiding the strait of gibraltar . the impulsor of the canal del lanquedoc was pierre paul riquet , count of caraman and great-grandfather of joseph riquet , also count of caraman and later prince of chimay and the last husband of teresa cabarrus galabert . the family relationship between several members of the cabarrus family and the lesseps family , one of whose most notable members was ferdinand de lesseps , builder of the suez canal probably also influenced in this canal building impulse . as one of the most influential members of the council of finance , he had planned many reforms in that department . when charles iii died , and the reactionary administration of charles iv put           taken an active part in reform were suspected and prosecuted . cabarrus himself was accused of embezzlement and thrown into prison in the castle of batres , a town near madrid .  under french domination  after two years he was released , created a count and employed in stately missions - he would even have been sent to paris as spanish ambassador , had not the french directory objected to him as being of french birth . cabarrus took no part in the maneuvers through which charles iv was obliged to abdicate and make way for joseph bonaparte , brother of napoleon bonaparte , but his french birth and intimate knowledge of spanish affairs recommended him to the emperor as the fittest person for the difficult post of minister of finance , which he held at his death . he died in seville while on a trip accompanying joseph bonaparte and is buried in the cathedral of seville .  legacy  due to the support he had given joseph bonaparte during his short reign in spain , he was considered           had already died , when ferdinand vii recovered the throne , his family was persecuted and his fortune and holdings were confiscated . there is even a rumor that states that his remains were removed from his tomb in the cathedral of seville and thrown into the guadalquivir . with all of the political turmoil of the following period , the heritage he left his heirs was restored and confiscated several times depending on who would be governing in madrid . his son , heir and second   conde de cabarrus   , domingo cabarrs galabert , held several positions in government and was governor of the provinces of palencia and valladolid among other official posts . his beautiful daughter , teresa cabarrus galabert , thrse tallien , also madamme tallien , played a part in the later stages of the french revolution , being named as notre dame de buon secours and notre dame de thermidor by her contemporaries . one of his grandsons domingo cabarrus quilty married enriqueta kirkpatrick y grivegne , sister of manuela kirkpatrick y           emperor napoleon iii of france , and of the duquesa de alba . domingo cabarrus quilty died before his father , domingo cabarrus galabert and therefore did not become the third count of cabarrus , title that was inherited by his daughter , paulina cabarrus kirkpatrick , as third countess of cabarrus . francisco cabarrus lalanne also acquired the title of viscount of rabouilhet from pedro pablo abarca de bolea , count of aranda , originally for his other son , francisco cabarrus galabert , but the early death of this son made him join both titles and up to today the present counts of cabarrus carry also the title of viscounts of rabouilhet . the town of rabouilhet and its neighboring towns and countryside are in the lanquedoc region of france . his close friend , francisco goya , painted a full body portrait of him . this portrait is currently exhibited in the bank of spain building in madrid .  notes 
infobox aircraft begin infobox aircraft type the mcdonnell douglas md-80 is a family of twin-engine , short- to medium-range , single-aisle commercial jet airliners . the md-80 series were lengthened and updated from the dc-9 . the airliner family can seat from 130 up to 172 passengers depending on variant and seating configuration . the md-80 series was introduced into commercial service on october 10 , 1980 by swissair . the series includes the md-81 , md-82 , md-83 , md-87 , and md-88 . these all have the same fuselage length except the shortened md-87 . the md-80 series was followed into service in modified form by the md-90 in 1995 and the md-95/boeing 717 in 1999.  design and development   background  douglas aircraft developed the dc-9 in the 1960s as a short-range companion to their larger dc-8 . the dc-9 was an all-new design , using two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines , and a t-tail . the dc-9 has a narrow-body fuselage design with five-abreast seating , and holds 80 to 135 passengers depending on seating arrangement and aircraft version . the md-80           was originally called the dc-9-80 series and the dc-9 super 80 and entered service in 1980 . the md-80 series was then developed into the md-90 entering service in 1995 . the last variant of the family was the md-95 , which was renamed the boeing 717-200 after mcdonnell douglas s merger with boeing in 1997 . the dc-9 family is one of the most successful jet airliners with a total of over 2,400 units produced ; it ranks third behind the second place airbus a320 family with over 4,000 produced , and the first place boeing 737 with over 7,000 produced .  md-80 series  the   md-80 series   is a mid-size , medium-range airliner that was introduced in 1980 . the design was the second generation of the dc-9 with two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines , small , highly efficient wings , and a t-tail . the aircraft has distinctive five-abreast seating in coach class . it was a lengthened dc-9-50 with a higher maximum take-off weight and a higher fuel capacity . the aircraft series was designed for frequent , short-haul           and seating arrangement . the development of md-80 series began in the 1970s as a growth version of the dc-9 series 50 . availability of new pratt &amp; whitney jt8d higher-bypass engines drove early studies including designs known as series 55 , series 50 , and series 60 . the design effort focused on the series 55 in august 1977 . with the projected entry into service in 1980 , the design was marketed as the   dc-9 series 80   . swissair launched the series 80 in october 1977 with an order for 15 plus an option for five . the series 80 featured a fuselage 14ft3in m longer than the dc-9-50 . the dc-9 wings were redesigned by adding sections at the wing root and tip for a 28% larger wing . the initial series 80 first flew october 19 , 1979 . it entered service in 1980 . originally it was certified as a version of the dc-9 , but was changed to md-80 in july 1983 , as a marketing move . new versions of the series were initially the           certification was dc-9-81/82 etc . only the md-88 was given an md certification , as was the later md-90 . the md-80 versions have cockpit , avionics and aerodynamic upgrades along with the more powerful , more efficient and quieter jt8d-200 series engines , which are a significant upgrade over the smaller jt8d-15 , -17 , -11 , and -9 series . the md-80 series aircraft also have longer fuselages than their earlier   dc-9   counterparts , as well as longer range . some customers , such as american airlines , still refer to the planes in fleet documentation as super 80 . this model is still flown extensively by american airlines and delta air lines . comparable airliners to the md-80 series include the boeing 737-400 and airbus a320 . in 2012 a freighter version has been created by converting surplus passenger planes .  flight testing and certification  the first md-80 , dc-9 line number 909 , made its first flight on october 19 , 1979 . test flying , despite two aircraft substantially damaged in accidents , was completed on august 25 , 1980           md-81 , was certificated under an amendment to the faa type certificate for the dc-9 . the flight-testing leading up to certification had involved three aircraft accumulating a total of 1085 flying hours on 795 flights . the first delivery , to launch customer swissair took place on september 13 , 1980.  model designation  as the md-80 was not in effect a new aircraft , it continues to be operated under an amendment to the original dc-9 faa aircraft type certificate . the type certificate issued to the aircraft manufacturer carries the aircraft model designations exactly as it appears on the manufacturer s application , including use of hyphens or decimal points , and should match what is stamped on the aircraft s data or nameplate . what the manufacturer chooses to call an aircraft for marketing or promotional purposes is irrelevant to the airworthiness authorities . the first amendment to the dc-9 type certificate for the new md-80 aircraft was applied as dc-9-81 , which approved on august 26 , 1980           amendments to the dc-9 type certificate . in 1983 , mcdonnell douglas decided that the dc-9-80 would be designated the md-80 . instead of merely using the md- prefix as a marketing symbol , an application was made to again amend the type certificate to include the md-81 , md-82 , and md-83 . this change was dated march 10 , 1986 , and the type certificate declared that although the md designator could be used in parentheses , it must be accompanied by the official designation , for example : dc-9-81 . all long beach aircraft in the md-80 series thereafter had md-81 , md-82 , or md-83 stamped on the aircraft nameplate . although not certified until october 21 , 1987 , mcdonnell douglas had already applied for models dc-9-87 and dc-9-87f on february 14 , 1985 . third derivative was similarly officially designated dc-9-87 , although no nameplates were stamped dc-9-87 . for the md-88 , an application for a type certificate model amendment was made after the earlier changes , so there never was a dc-9-88 ,           , 1987 . the faa s online aircraft registry database shows the dc-9-88 and dc-9-80 designations in existence but unused .  production  the md-80 was produced on a common line with the dc-9 with which it shares its line number sequence . after the delivery of 976 dc-9s and 108 md-80s , mcdonnell douglas stopped dc-9 production . hence , commencing with the 1,085th dc-9/md-80 delivery , an md-82 for viasa in december 1982 , all dc-9s produced were series 80s/md-80s . in addition to the long beach , california line , a second assembly line was set up at shanghai , where aircraft were to be built under license . during 1991 , md-80 production had reached a peak of 12 per month , having been running at approximately 10 per month since 1987 and was expected to continue at this rate in the near term . as a result of the decline in the air traffic and a slow market response to the md-90 , md-80 production was reduced , and 84 aircraft were handed over in 1992 .           1993 and 22 aircraft were handed over . md-80 production ended in 1999.  derivative designs  the md-90 was developed from the md-80 series and is a 5ftm adj=mid , updated version of the md-88 with a similar electronic flight instrument system , and improved , and quieter iae v2500 turbofan engines . the md-90 program began in 1989 , first flown in 1993 , and entered commercial service in 1995 . a number of other variants were proposed that never entered production . one proposal was the md-94x , which was fitted with unducted fan turbofan engines . previously , an md-81 was used as a testbed for unducted fan engines , such as the general electric ge36 and the pratt &amp; whitney/allison 578-dx . the md-95 was developed to replace early dc-9 models , then approaching 30 years old . the project completely overhauled the original dc-9 into a modern airliner . it is slightly longer than the dc-9-30 and is powered by new rolls-royce br715 engines . the md-95 was renamed boeing 717 after the           md-80 series has been used by airlines around the world . major customers have included aerolneas argentinas , aeromxico , aeropostal aerorepublica , alaska airlines , alitalia , allegiant air , american airlines , aserca , austral lneas areas , austrian airlines , avianca , china eastern airlines , china northern airlines , delta air lines , finnair , iberia , japan air system , korean air , lion air , martinair holland , pacific southwest airlines , reno air , scandinavian airlines system , spanair , insel air , swissair , and trans world airlines . due to the usage of the aging jt8d engine , the md-80 is not fuel efficient compared to the a320 or newer 737 models ; it burns 1050usgal l of jet fuel per hour on a typical flight , while the larger boeing 737-800 burns only 850usgal l per hour . starting in the 2000s , many airlines began to retire the type . alaska airlines  tipping point in using the 737-800 was the $4 per gallon price of jet           ; the airline stated that a typical los angeles-seattle flight would cost $2,000 less , using a boeing 737-800 , than the same flight using an md-80 . american airlines has announced plans to retire at least 20 md-80s , and has accelerated delivery of new 737-800s , while midwest airlines announced on july 14 , 2008 , that it would retire all 12 of its md-80s by the fall . the jt8d s comparatively lower maintenance costs due to simpler design help narrow the fuel cost gap .  variants   md-81  the md-81 was the first production model of the md-80 , and apart from the md-87 , the differences between the various long body md-80 variants is relatively minor . the four long body models only differ from each other in having different engine variants , fuel capacities , and weights . the md-88 and later build versions of the other models           dimensions : the basic long body md-80 versions have an overall length of 147ft10 in , and a fuselage length of 136ft5 in that is 4.62 m longer than the dc-9-50 and 13.51 m longer than the initial dc-9 , the series 10 . wingspan was also increased by 4.4 m in comparison with earlier dc-9s at 107ft10.2 in . the aircraft s passenger cabin , from cockpit door to aft bulkhead , is 101ft0 in long and , as with all versions of the dc-9 , has a maximum cabin width of 123.7 in . powerplant : the initial production version of the md-80 was the pratt and whitney jt8d-209 18500lbf kn thrust powered md-81 . later build md-81s have been delivered with more powerful jt8d-217 and -219 engines . apu : all versions of the md-80 are equipped with an alliedsignal gtcp85-98d apu as standard , which is located in the aft fuselage . performance : standard mtow on the md-81 is 140000lb kg with the option to increase to 142000lb kg .           with 155 passengers , is 1,565 nmi . flight deck : the md-80 is equipped with a two crew flightdeck similar to that on the dc-9 from which it evolved . later models could be equipped to a higher specification with efis displays in place of the traditional analogue instruments , tcas , windshear detection , etc . an efis retrofit to non-efis equipped aircraft is possible . cabin : typical passenger cabin seating arrangements include : : a mixed-class , with aft full-service galley , configuration for a total of 135 passengers with 12 first class , four-abreast 36-inch seat pitch . : 123 economy-class passengers , five-abreast , 32 in pitch . : all-economy layout for 155 passengers , five-abreast , 32- and 33-inch pitch . : a typical high-density layout is for 167 one class . undercarriage : all versions of the md-80 are equipped with a tricycle undercarriage , featuring a twin nose unit with spray deflector and twin main units with rock deflectors . the md-80t , developed for the chinese , differs in that the main units are each fitted           loading . aerodynamic improvements : from mid-1987 , new md-87-style low-drag beaver tail cones were introduced on all series of md-80s , reducing drag and hence improving fuel burn . it would seem that some operators have been modifying the old dc-9-style cones on earlier-build md-80s to the new low-drag style . sas is one airline that has done this , citing both the improved economics as well as cosmetic improvement for the modification .  md-81 timeline  * formal launch : october 1977. * first flight : october 18 , 1979. * faa certification : august 25 , 1980. * first delivery : september 13 , 1980 to swissair * entry into service : october 10 , 1980

those of the md-81 but equipped with more powerful engines . the md-82 was intended for operation from  hot and high  airports but also           airfields . american airlines is the world s largest operator of the md-82 , with at one point over 300 md-82s in the fleet . originally certificated with 20000lbf kn thrust jt8d-217s , a -217a-powered md-82 was certificated in mid-1982 and became available that year . the new version featured a higher mtow , while the jt8d-217as had a guaranteed take-off thrust at temperature of up to 29 degrees c or 5000ft m altitude . the jt8d-217c engines were also offered on the md-82 , giving improved sfc . several operators took delivery of the -219-powered md-82s , while balair ordered its md-82s powered by the lower-thrust -209 engine . the md-82 features an increased standard mtow initially to 147000lb kg , and this was later increased to 149500lb kg . standard fuel capacity is the same as that of the md-81 , 5840usgal l , and typical range with 155 passengers is 2050 nmi.  md-82 timeline  * announced/go-ahead : april 16 , 1979. * first flight : january 8 , 1981. * faa certification : july 29 , 1981. * first delivery : august

industrial corporation since november 1986 ; the sub-assemblies were delivered by mcdonnell douglas in kit form . china had begun a pure cargo version design , designated as y-13 , but the project was subsequently cancelled with the conclusion of the license assembly of md-82/90 in china .  md-83  the md-83 is a longer range version of the basic md-81/82 with higher weights , more powerful engines , and increased fuel capacity . powerplant : compared to earlier models , the md-83 is equipped with slightly more powerful 21000lbf kn thrust pratt and whitney jt8d-219s as standard . performance : the md-83 features increased fuel capacity as standard , which is carried in two 565usgal l auxiliary tanks located fore and aft of the centre section . the aircraft also has higher operating weights , with mtow increased to 160000lb kg and mlw           155 passengers is around 2504 nmi . to cope with the higher operating weights , the md-83 incorporates strengthened landing gear including new wheels , tires , and brakes , changes to the wing skins , front spar web and elevator spar cap , and strengthened floor beams and panels to carry the auxiliary fuel tanks . from md-80 line number 1194 , an md-81 delivered in september 1985 , it is understood that all md-80s have the same basic wing structure and in theory could be converted to md-83 standard .  md-83 timeline  * announced/go-ahead

seat between 109 and 130 passengers depending upon configuration . the designation was intended to indicate its planned date of entry into service , 1987 . dimensions : with an overall length of 130ft5 in , the md-87 is 17ft4 in shorter than the other md-80s but is otherwise generally similar to them , employing the same engines , systems and flight deck . the md-87 features modifications to its tail , with a fin extension above the tailplane . it also introduced a new low drag beaver tail cone , which became standard on all md-80s . powerplant : the md-87 was offered with either the 20000lbf kn thrust jt8d-217c or the 21000lbf kn thrust -219 . performance : two basic versions of the md-87 were made available with either an mtow of 140000lb kg and mlw of 128000lb kg or an mtow of 149000lb kg and an mlw of 130000lb kg . fuel capacity is 5840 usgal , increasing to 6970 usgal with the incorporation of two auxiliary           2370 nmi increasing to 2900 nmi with two auxiliary fuel

aircraft . the md-88 is , depending on specification , basically similar to the md-82 or md-83 except that it incorporates an efis cockpit instead of the more traditional analog flight deck of the other md-80s . other changes incorporated into the md-88 include a wind shear warning system           changes are relatively minor and were written back as standard on the md-82/83 . the wind shear warning system was offered as a standard option on all other md-80s and has been made available for retrofitting on earlier aircraft including the dc-9 . delta s earlier delivered md-82s were upgraded to md-88 specification . when mcdonnell douglas was asked why these aircraft were md-88s and not md-82s they said that the customer , delta air lines , thought that its specification was sufficiently different to warrant a new designation . although delivered in december 1987 , delta put the aircraft into service only in january 1988 . performance : the md-88 has the same weights , range , and airfield performance as the other long-body aircraft and is powered by the same engines . mdc quotes a typical range for the md-88 as 2050 nmi with 155 passengers . range with 155 passenger is increased to 2504 nmi with two additional auxiliary fuel tanks .  md-88 timeline  * announced/go-ahead : january 23 , 1986. * first flight :           , 1987. * first delivery : december 19 , 1987 to delta air lines . * entry into service : january 5 , 1988 with delta air lines . * last delivery : june 25 , 1997 to onur air .  undeveloped variants   md-80 advanced  mcdonnell douglas revealed at the end of 1990 that it would be developing an md-80 improvement package with the intent to offer beginning in early 1991 for delivery from mid-1993 . the aircraft became known as the   md-80 advanced   . the main improvement was the installation of pratt &amp; whitney jt8d-290 engines with a 1.5 in larger diameter fan and would , it was hoped , allow a 6 db reduction in exterior noise . due to lack of market interest , mcdonnell douglas dropped its plans to offer the md-80 advanced during 1991 . then in 1993 , a mark 2 md-80 advanced version reappeared with the modified jt8d-290 engines as previously proposed . the company also evaluated the addition of winglets on the md-80 . in late 1993 , pratt &amp; whitney launched a modified version           being offered for the dc-9x re-engining program , and was also evaluating the possibility of developing a new jt8d for possible retrofit on the md-80 . the engine would also be available on new build md-80s . the 18000lbf kn to 19000lbf kn thrust -218b engine version shares a 98% commonality with the existing engine , with changes designed to reduce nox , improve durability , and reduce noise levels by 3 db . the 218b could be certificated in early to mid-1996 . the new engine , dubbed the 8000 , was to feature a new fan of increased diameter , extended exhaust cone , a larger lp compressor , a new annular burner , and a new lp turbine and mixer . the initial thrust rating would be around 21700lbf kn thrust . a launch decision on the new engine was expected by mid-1994 , but never occurred . the md-80 advanced was also to offer a new flight deck instrumentation package and a completely new passenger compartment design . these changes would be available by retrofit to existing md-80s , and was forecast           was to incorporate the advanced flight deck of the md-88 , including a choice of reference systems , with an inertial reference system as standard fitting and optional attitude-heading equipment . it was to be equipped with an electronic flight instrument system , an optional second flight management system , light emitting diode dot matrix electronic engine and system displays . a honeywell windshear computer and provision for an optional traffic-alert and collision avoidance system were also to be included . a new interior would have a 12% increase in overhead baggage space and stowage compartment lights that come on when the door opens , as well as new video system featuring drop-down lcd monitors above . the lack of market interest for the md-80 advanced during 1991 led mcdonnell douglas to drop its plans for the development .  derivatives  the md-90-30 is a stretched variant with updated glass cockpit and two v2500 engines , also extended range version as the md-90-30er . the md-95 was developed as a replacement for the earlier dc-9-30           are 577 md-80 series aircraft in service as of september 2013 , with operators including american airlines , delta air lines and allegiant air , along with several other carriers with smaller fleets , such as khors air , bulgarian air charter , meridiana and kam air .  deliveries   incidents and accidents  as of february 2013 , the md-80 series has been involved in 61 incidents , including 31 hull-loss accidents , with 1,330 fatalities of occupants .  notable accidents and incidents  * on december 1 , 1981 , inex-adria

andover is a town in the english county of hampshire . the town is on the river anton some 18.5 miles west of the town of basingstoke , 18.5 miles north-west of the city of winchester and 25 miles north of the city of southampton . andover is twinned with the towns of redon in france , goch in germany , and andover , massachusetts in the united states .  history   early history  its name is recorded in anglo-saxon in 955 ad as   andeferas   , and is thought to be of celtic origin : compare welsh   onn dwfr   = ash water . andover s first mention in history is in 950 when king edred is recorded as having built a royal hunting lodge there . in 962 king edgar called a meeting of the saxon  parliament  at his hunting lodge near andover . of more importance was the baptism , in 994 of a viking king named olaf           identity of that man was either olav trygvason or olof sktkonung . the baptism was part of a deal with king ethelred ii of england whereby he stopped ravaging england and returned home . olav tryggvason became king of norway in 995 and tried to convert his country to christianity before his death in battle in 1000 . olof sktkonung was already king of sweden and became its first christian king and began c. 995 to mint sweden s first coins with the help of english expertise . at the time of the domesday book andover had 107 male inhabitants and probably had a total population of about 500 . it was quite a large settlement by the standards of the time . . andover also had 6 watermills which ground grain to flour . in 1175 king richard i sold andover a charter granting the townspeople certain rights , forming a merchant guild which took over the government of the town . the members elected two officials called bailiffs who ran the town           to collect royal taxes in andover themselves . in 1256 henry iii gave the townspeople the right to hold a court and try criminals for offences committed in andover . andover also sent mps to the parliaments of 1295 and 1302-1307 . the town was ravaged by two serious fires , one in 1141 and another in 1435 . andover remained a small market town . processing wool appears to have been the main industry and street names in the area of the town known as sheep fair commemorate this . a weekly market , and an annual fair were held . as well as the church of st mary the town had a priory and a hospital run by monks , dedicated to st john the baptist , and also a lepers hostel to st mary magdalene . in 1538 during the reformation henry viii closed the priory and the hospital . in 1571 a free school for the boys of andover was established . this in time became andover grammar school , and is now john hanson community school . in 1599 the town received a new charter from elizabeth i. the

july 1854 ; this railway also linking the town to salisbury . the town was also linked by railway           , but this was closed down in 1964 . the land , together with the adjacent gasworks and p. m. coombes woodyards , was then sold to the tsb trust company who later built their headquarters there . the population grew from 3,304 in 1801 to 5,501 in 1871 . during the 19th century the town acquired all the usual additions , a theatre in 1803 , gas street lighting in 1838 , a fire station and cottage hospital in 1877 , a swimming pool opened in 1885 and a recreation ground opened in 1887 . a water company was formed in 1875 to provide piped water to the town and a system of sewers and drains was built in 1899-1902 . the public library opened in 1897 . despite this burgeoning of the amenities of the town in 1845 a notorious scandal involving the hardships endured by the inmates of the workhouse led indirectly to reform of the poor law act . the town was one of the boroughs reformed by the municipal reform act 1835 . in 1846 , the town came to public attention after an enquiry exposed           brought to light evidence of beatings , sexual abuse and general mistreatment of workhouse inmates by the overseers . the woollen industry had declined but new industries took its place . taskers waterloo ironworks opened at anna valley in 1809 and flourished . many examples of

andover airfield , to the south of the town , during the first world war and became the site of the raf staff college . in 1932 andover gained a new industry when the printers for kelly s directory moved to the town . slowly the town grew from about 11,000 and by 1960 had a population of about 17,000 , because already some londoners were being housed in the first of the council houses/flats being constructed . during the second world war the raf staff college was the headquarters of raf maintenance command , and gained a unique place in british history , as the first           was formed in january 1945 at raf andover . the airfield is no longer in use although the raf retains a link to the area through the presence of 1213 squadron , air training corps . when the raf left the site became the headquarters of the quartermaster general and later logistics executive . in 2001 , the defence logistics organisation was formed and andover became one of its major sites . since 2012 ,

commons since 1997 by sir george young , a conservative . in 1951 the town council decided it would be a good idea to add fluoride to the drinking water to improve dental health . this provoked a furious public response , and a strong anti-fluoridation campaign started . in the 1958 local elections anti-fluoridation candidates swept the board , turning out many established members , and the idea was dropped . in 1950s the borough council was approached by the greater london council to become an overspill town , to build houses and take people and industry relocated from the overcrowded capital . some contend that had the old borough council still been in charge this would never have been agreed . but it was , and in 1961 the plan was drawn up to expand to a population of some 47,000 by 1982 ,           new council houses were ready by 1954 and by 1981 the population had risen to 51,000 . a bypass , industrial estates and a new shopping centre in the town centre , called the chantry centre , were all built and the towns character changed completely . the new council houses proved to be very badly built . it seemed that the local council would have to foot the enormous bill for reconstruction , but after starting legal action against the greater london council a settlement was achieved , in which the glc paid a large sum of money to the local council , which started a programme of refurbishment that finished in 1995 . the borough council and andover rural district council were abolished in the local government reorganisation of 1974 , and replaced by test valley

peaked in 1987 , becoming the second of only two cyclists to win the triple crown of victories in the tour de france and the giro ditalia stage races , plus the world road race championship . roche s rise coincided with that of fellow irishman sean kelly . although one of the finest cyclists of his generation and           injuries and never contended in the grand tours post-1987 . he had 58 professional career wins . all of these wins still stand , despite roche having been accused by an italian judge of taking epo in the later part of his career .  early life and amateur career  on completion of his apprenticeship as a machinist in a dublin dairy and following a successful amateur career in ireland with the orwell wheelers club coached by noel oneill of dundrum , roche joined the athletic club de boulogne-billancourt amateur team in paris to prepare for the 1980 olympic games in moscow . soon after his arrival roche won the amateur parisroubaix , escaping with dirk demol and sprinting to victory on the track at roubaix . roche was told by his directeur sportif that if he did not win he would be sent home to ireland that day . he also finished on the podium at the early-season paris ezy road           race which was won by bob downs . however , a knee injury caused by a poorly fitted shoe plate led to a disappointing ride in moscow , where he finished 45th . however , on return to france , august to october saw roche win 19 races . that led to a contract with the peugeot professional cycling team for 1981.  professional career  roche scored his first professional victory by beating bernard hinault in the tour of corsica . less than a month later he won parisnice despite illness following the descent from mont ventoux and finished his debut season with victories in the tour de corse , circuit dindre-et-loire and etoile des espoirs races with a second place behind hinault in the grand prix des nations . in total , his debut yielded 10 victories . in 1982 his best performance was second in the amstel gold race behind jan raas , but his rise continued in 1983 with victories in the tour de romandie , grand prix de           1983 tour de france

position , 4 minutes and 29 seconds behind winner bernard hinault.  chronic knee injury  in 1986 at a six-day event with uk professional tony doyle at paris-bercy , roche crashed at speed and damaged his right knee . this destroyed his 1986 season at new team with little to           . roche finished the 1986 tour de france 48th , 1h 32m behind greg lemond , a tour that roche described as like entering a dark tunnel of pain . the injury and then associated back problems recurred throughout his career and a series of operations appeared to only address direct or consequential symptoms of the core injury . later non-surgical intervention under dr.hans-wilhelm mller-wohlfahrt in munich made some difference but the injury required constant care . by the end of his career roche was unable to compete at his best because of back problem which led to a loss of power in the left leg . in retirement he described riding the 1993 tour de france just for fun . he finished 13th , riding for claudio chiappucci ) .  1987 triple crown  in 1987 , roche had a tremendous season . in the spring , he won the volta a la comunitat valenciana , taking a third victory in the tour de romandie and fourth place plus a stage           , the closest he got to winning a professional  monument  classic . he blamed it on tactical naivet and riding like an amateur . in the giro ditalia , roche took three stage wins en route to overall victory and became the first giro victor from outside mainland europe . roche s stage wins that year in the giro were stage 1b , the 8 km time trial downhill on the poggio into san remo and stage 22 , a 32 km individual time trial into st. vincent . despite his stage wins , the race is remembered for the stage from lido di jesolo to sappada , where roche , contravening team orders , broke away alone early and despite being caught late in the race , had the strength to go with the counterattack and take the pink jersey from his team-mate roberto visentini , who had been previously leading the classification . his behaviour in the stage gained him the tifosi s hatred . it was said the only member of his team that           his domestique eddy schepers , although roche recruited panasonic riders and old acbb team-mates robert millar and australian phil anderson to protect him with schepers on the marmolada climb . roche finished the giro exhausted but favourite for the tour de france . following bernard hinault s retirement , laurent fignon s choppy form and with greg lemond injured following an accidental shooting while hunting , the 1987 tour was open . it was also one of the most mountainous since the war , with 25 stages . roche won the 87.5 km individual time trial stage 10 to futuroscope and came second on stage 19 . on the next stage , crossing the galibier and madeleine and finishing at la plagne , roche attacked early , was away for several hours but was caught on the last climb . his nearest rival pedro delgado then attacked . despite being almost 1 and a half minutes in arrears midway up the last climb , roche pulled the deficit back to 4 seconds . roche collapsed and lost consciousness and was given oxygen           he replied oui , mais pas de femme toute de suite . the yellow jersey changed hands several times with charly mottet , roche , jean franois bernard and delgado all wearing it before roche used the final 35 km time trial to overturn a half-minute gap and win the tour by 40 seconds , which was at the time the second narrowest margin . roche became only the fifth cyclist in history to win the tour and the giro in the same year . he was also the only irishman to win the tour de france . irish taoiseach charles haughey joined roche on the podium on the champs-lyses . later that year , with victory at the world road race championship in villach in austria , roche became only the second to win the triple crown of cycling . roche arrived with insufficient training although           for his team-mate sean kelly and escaped in the race winning break only while covering for his countryman . with moreno argentin in the following group , kelly did not chase and as the break slowed and jostling for position began for a sprint , roche attacked 500 m from the finish and crossed the line with metres to spare . victory in the season-long   super prestige pernod international   competition was assured . roche was given the freedom of dublin in late september 1987 . several days later the 1987 edition of the nissan classic began and roche rode strongly to finish second behind kelly .  post-1987 career  at the close of 1987 , roche moved to fagor mbk , bringing english riders sean yates and malcolm elliot , 1984 tour de france king of the mountains winner robert millar and domestique eddy schepers . the team was criticised for containing too many english speakers . the 1988 season began badly with a recurrence of the knee injury and roche began a gradual decline . in 1989 he again took second in parisnice and en route to a final ninth place . riding the last edition of the nissan classic tour of ireland , roche was in many breaks but finished fifth . a year later , he was again ninth in the 1993 giro ditalia and           at the end of an anonymous 1993 which yielded a single win , in the post-tour de france criterium at chateau chinon.  alleged doping  in may 1990 , paul kimmage a former professional , fagor team mate of roche and a fellow dubliner published an account of life in the peloton . his book   rough ride   exposed drug use apparently endemic in the peloton but spoke in fawning terms about roche . publication resulted in a threat of litigation from roche . it was reported in the rome newspaper , la repubblica , in january 2000 that francesco conconi , a professor at the university of ferrara involved with administering erythropoietin to riders on the carrera team with which roche had some of his best years , had provided riders including roche with epo . roche denied the allegations . this was further reported in the irish times several days later , roche again denying epo . in march 2000 the italian judge franca oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including conconi . this official judicial investigation unequivocally           last year in the peloton . files part of the investigation allegedly detail a number of aliases for roche including rocchi , rossi , rocca , roncati , righi and rossini . in 2004 judge oliva again alleged that roche had taken epo during 1993 but due to the

gabriel , today commonlyif incorrectlyknown as gabriel prosser , was a literate enslaved blacksmith who planned a large slave rebellion in the richmond area in the summer of 1800 . information regarding the revolt was leaked prior to its execution , and he and twenty-five followers were taken captive and hanged in punishment . in reaction , virginia and other state legislatures passed restrictions on free blacks , as well as prohibiting the education , assembly , and hiring out of slaves , to restrict their chances to learn and to plan similar rebellions . in 2002 the city of richmond passed a resolution in honor of gabriel on the 202nd anniversary of the rebellion . in 2007 governor tim kaine gave gabriel and his followers an informal pardon , in recognition that his cause , the end of slavery and the furtherance of equality for all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history .  life and background  born into slavery at brookfield , a tobacco plantation in henrico county , virginia , gabriel had two brothers , solomon           , the owner . as gabriel and solomon were trained as blacksmiths , their father may have had that skill . gabriel was also taught to read and write . by the mid-1790s , as gabriel neared the age of twenty , he stood six feet two or three inches high . his long and bony face , well made , was marred by the loss of his two front teeth and two or three scars on his head . white people as well as blacks regarded the literate young man as a fellow of great courage and intellect above his rank in life .  gabriel s rebellion  gabriel planned the revolt during the spring and summer of 1800 . on august 30 , 1800 , gabriel intended to lead slaves into richmond , but the rebellion was postponed because of rain . the slaves  owners had suspicion of the uprising , and two slaves told their owner , mosby sheppard , about the plans . he warned virginia s governor , james monroe , who called out the state militia . gabriel escaped downriver to norfolk ,           for the reward offered by the state . that slave did not receive the full reward . gabriel was returned to richmond for questioning , but he did not submit . gabriel , his two brothers , and 23 other slaves were hanged .  historiography  the historian douglas egerton offered a new perspective on gabriel in his book   gabriel s rebellion : the virginia slave conspiracies of 1800 &amp; 1802   . he based this on extensive primary research from surviving contemporary documents . egerton found that gabriel was a skilled blacksmith who was mostly hired out by his owner in richmond foundries . hiring out was the way that slaveholders earned money from their slaves , whom they needed less for labor as they had reduced the cultivation of tobacco as a crop . the market for tobacco was depressed , but virginia planters also had to deal with depleted soils because of the crop . slaveholders leased skilled slaves for jobs available in virginia industries . egerton concluded that gabriel would have been stimulated and challenged at the foundries by interacting           they hoped thomas jefferson s republicans would liberate them from domination by the wealthy federalist merchants of the city . in that environment , gabriel also would have heard about the uprising and struggles of slaves in saint domingue . egerton believed that gabriel had two white co-conspirators , at least one of whom was identified as a french national . he found reports that documentary evidence of their identity or involvement was sent to governor monroe but never produced in court , and suggests that it was to protect the jefferson s democratic-republican party . egerton noted that gabriel did not order his followers to kill all whites except methodists , quakers and frenchmen ; rather , he instructed them not to kill any people in those three categories . during this period , methodists and quakers were active missionaries for manumission , and many slaves had been freed since the end of the revolution in part due to their work . the french were considered allies as they had abolished slavery in their caribbean colonies in 1794 . gabriel initially escaped on a ship owned by a former overseer           who repeatedly overlooked information as to gabriel s true identity . a slave hired out to work on the ship turned in gabriel , seeking the reward so that he could purchase his own freedom . the state paid him only $50 , not the $300 advertised .  influence  gabriel s uprising was notable not because of its resultsthe rebellion was quelled before it could beginbut because of its potential for mass chaos and widespread violence . in virginia in 1800 , 39.2 percent of the total population were slaves ; they were concentrated on plantations in the tidewater area and west of richmond . no reliable numbers existed regarding slave and free black conspirators ; most likely , the number of men actively involved numbered only several hundred . from 1780 to 1810 , the number of slaves freed in the upper south had grown markedly , as some slaveholders were inspired to free slaves by the american revolution and its ideals . methodists and quakers especially worked to convince slaveholders to manumit slaves . the percentage of free blacks as part of the black population rose from           percent by 1810 . by that time , virginia s free blacks numbered 30,466 or 7.2 percent of the total black population . by 1810 nearly three-quarters of delaware s blacks were free . some virginia slaveholders were nervous about the sharp increase in the number of free blacks in the slave state . they were uneasy as well by the violent aftermath of the french revolution and the uprising of slaves in the 1790s in saint domingue . in 1792 france granted social equality to free people of color , and in 1793 french revolutionary commissioners in saint-domingue granted freedom to all the slaves . whites and free people of color , some of whom were also slaveholders , emigrated as refugees to the us during the years of upheaval , now known as the haitian revolution . they added to the population of free people of color in charleston , richmond and new orleans . in addition , slaveholders brought thousands of ethnic african slaves with them , especially adding to the african population of new orleans . in 1804 the black and mulatto revolutionaries succeeded in gaining freedom           . gabriel had been able to plan the rebellion because of relatively lax rules of movement for slaves between plantations and the city , as so many had been hired out , and others traveled to and from the city on errands for their masters . after the rebellion , many slaveholders greatly restricted the slaves  rights of travel when not working . fears of a slave revolt regularly swept major slaveholding communities . prior to the rebellion , virginia law had allowed education of slaves to read and write , and training of slaves in skilled trades . after the rebellion , and after a second conspiracy was discovered in 1802 among enslaved boatmen along the appomattox and roanoke rivers , the virginia assembly in 1808 banned hiring out of slaves and required freed blacks to leave the state within 12 months or face re-enslavement . free blacks had to petition the legislature to stay in the state , and were often aided in that goal by white friends or allies . in addition to the catalyst of gabriel s rebellion , the law against residency           people of color in virginia , as noted above in manumission of slaves after the american revolution . the very existence of free blacks challenged the conditions of slave states .  legacy and honors  gabriel s rebellion served as an important example of slaves  taking action to gain freedom . * in 2002 the city of richmond adopted a resolution to commemorate the 202nd anniversary of the execution of the patriot and freedom fighter , gabriel , whose death stands as a symbol for the determination and struggle of slaves to obtain freedom , justice and equality as promised by the fundamental principles of democratic governments of the commonwealth of virginia and the united states of america . * in the fall of 2006 , the virginia state conference of the naacp requested gov . tim kaine pardon gabriel in recognition of his contributions to the civil rights struggle of african americans and all peoples . * on august 30 , 2007 , governor kaine informally pardoned gabriel and his co-conspirators . kaine said that gabriel s motivation had been his devotion to the ideals of the american           noted that gabriel s causethe end of slavery and the furtherance of equality of all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history , and added that it is important to acknowledge that history favorably regards gabriel s cause while consigning legions who sought to keep him and others in chains to be forgotten . the pardon was informal because it was posthumous .  representation in other media  *arna bontemps wrote   black thunder   , a historical novel based on gabriel s rebellion .  songs  * tim barry , a singer/songwriter from richmond , wrote and performed prosser s gabriel for the album   28th &amp; stonewall   . it chronicles the events of gabriel s life , focusing on the attempted revolution . * gabriel is mentioned in public enemy s song prophets of rage . * gabriel is the hero of a cleverly subversive sea shanty recorded some forty years after events . ) in the book the shanty           to its subject as general gabriel , and claims a bounty of 1000 was put on his head . after being betrayed and captured he is heavily loaded with chains and a troop of light horse is appointed to guard him . he is taken before the governor , whose name is slightingly alluded to . the whole country turns out to see him . gabriel makes a last speech in which he proclaims his own right name and that he is here today and gone tomorrow / i did not come for to stay for ever . he is taken to the gallows in a wagon drawn by four grey horses . commenting with heavy irony that the execution was a very sad loss to major prosser the verse concludes by describing gabriel as the man who almost ruined old virginny .
in the mathematical discipline of linear algebra , the schur decomposition or schur triangulation , named after issai schur , is a matrix decomposition .  statement  the schur decomposition reads as follows : if   a   is a   n   &amp;times ;   n   square matrix with complex entries , then   a   can be expressed as : a = q u q-1 where   q   is a unitary matrix , and   u   is an upper triangular matrix , which is called a schur form of   a   . since   u   is similar to   a   , it has the same multiset of eigenvalues , and since it is triangular , those eigenvalues are the diagonal entries of   u   .           of   a   -invariant subspaces 0 =   v   0   v   1 ..   v n   = c   n   , and that there exists an ordered orthonormal basis such that the first   i   basis vectors span   v     i   for each   i   occurring in the nested sequence . phrased somewhat differently , the first part says that a linear operator   j   on a complex finite-dimensional vector space stabilizes a complete flag .  proof  a constructive proof for the schur decomposition is as follows : every operator   a   on a complex finite-dimensional vector space has an eigenvalue   &amp;lambda ;             ;   . let   v &amp;lambda ;   be its orthogonal complement . it is clear that , with respect to this orthogonal decomposition ,   a   has matrix representation : beginbmatrix z1 &amp; z2 endbmatrix* a beginbmatrixz1 &amp; z2endbmatrix = beginbmatrix lambda , ilambda &amp; a12 0 &amp; a22 endbmatrix : beginmatrix vlambda oplus vlambdaperp endmatrix rightarrow beginmatrix vlambda oplus vlambdaperp endmatrix where   i &amp;lambda ;   is the identity operator on   v &amp;lambda ;   . the above matrix would be upper-triangular except for the   a   22 block . but exactly the same procedure can be applied to the sub-matrix   a   22 , viewed             , and its submatrices . continue this way n times . thus the space c   n   will be exhausted and the procedure has yielded the desired result . the above argument can be slightly restated as follows : let   &amp;lambda ;   be an eigenvalue of   a   , corresponding to some eigenspace   v &amp;lambda ;   .   a   induces an operator   t   on the quotient space c   n   modulo   v &amp;lambda ;   . this operator is precisely the   a   22 submatrix from above . as before ,   t   would have an eigenspace , say   w &amp;mu ;   c   n   modulo   v &amp;lambda ;   . notice the preimage of   w &amp;mu ;   under the quotient            that contains   v &amp;lambda ;   . continue this way until the resulting quotient space has dimension 0 . then the successive preimages of the eigenspaces found at each step form a flag that   a   stabilizes.  notes  although every square matrix has a schur decomposition , in general this decomposition is not unique . for example , the eigenspace   v &amp;lambda ;   can have dimension 1 , in which case any orthonormal basis for   v &amp;lambda ;   would lead to the desired result . write the triangular matrix   u   as   u   =   d   +   n   , where   d   is diagonal and   n   is strictly upper triangular . the diagonal matrix   d   contains the eigenvalues of   a   in arbitrary order . the nilpotent part   n   is generally not unique either , but its frobenius norm is uniquely determined by   a   . it is clear that if   a   is a normal matrix , then   u   from its schur decomposition must be a diagonal matrix and the column vectors of   q   are the eigenvectors of   a   . therefore , the schur decomposition extends the spectral decomposition . in particular , if   a   is positive definite , the schur decomposition of   a   , its spectral decomposition , and its singular value decomposition coincide . a           of matrices can be simultaneously triangularized , i.e. there exists a unitary matrix   q   such that , for every   a i   in the given family ,   q a i q*   is upper triangular . this can be readily deduced from the above proof . take element   a   from   a i   and again consider an eigenspace   v a   . then   v a   is invariant under all matrices in   a i   . therefore all matrices in   a i   must share one common eigenvector in   v a   . induction then proves the claim . as a corollary , we have that every commuting family of normal matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized . in the infinite dimensional setting , not every bounded operator on a banach space has an invariant subspace . however , the upper-triangularization of an arbitrary           operator on a complex banach space has a nest of closed invariant subspaces.  computation  schur decomposition of a given matrix is known to be numerically computed by qr algorithm or its variants . in other words , the roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix are not necessarily computed ahead in order to obtain its schur decomposition . conversely , qr algorithm can be used to compute the roots of any given characteristic polynomial by finding the schur decomposition of its companion matrix . similarly , qr algorithm is used to compute the eigenvalues of any given matrix , which are the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix of the schur decomposition . see the nonsymmetric eigenproblems section in lapack users  guide .  applications  lie theory applications include : * every invertible operator is contained in a borel group . * every operator fixes a point of the flag manifold .  generalized schur decomposition  given square matrices   a   and   b   , the generalized schur decomposition factorizes both matrices as a=qsz* and           and   z   are unitary , and   s   and   t   are upper triangular . the generalized schur decomposition is also sometimes called the qz decomposition . the generalized eigenvalues lambda that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem ax=lambda bx can be calculated as the ratio of the diagonal elements of   s   to those of   t   . that is , using subscripts to denote matrix elements , the   i   th generalized eigenvalue lambdai satisfies lambdai=sii/tii .  references  **14;362474;references
constituencywestminster= torridge and west devon okehampton is a town and civil parish in west devon in the english county of devon . it is situated at the northern edge of dartmoor , and has an estimated population of 5,700.  history  okehampton was founded by the saxons . the earliest written record of the settlement is from 980 ad as ocmundtune , meaning settlement by the ockment , a river which runs through the town . it was recorded as a place for slaves to be freed at cross roads . like many towns in the west country , okehampton grew on the medieval wool trade . notable buildings in the town include the 15th century chapel of st. james and okehampton castle , which was established by the norman sheriff of devon , baldwin fitzgilbert.  feudal barony  okehampton was the caput of a large feudal barony , which at the time of the   domesday book   was held by baldwin fitzgilbert . after his death in 1090 the tenure of the barony is obscure for the next twenty years after which           death in 1173 , which passed to her daughter , hawise de curci , who married reginald de courtenay . his french possessions were confiscated by the french king louis vii , but were given , together with the marriage of his daughter elizabeth de courtenay , to his youngest brother peter i of courtenay . the courtenay family rebuilt okehampton castle , until king henry viii seized the lands and had henry courtenay , 1st marquess of exeter executed for treason in 1539 . presently , the castle is owned by english heritage and is open to the public during the summer season . the town is also home to the museum of dartmoor life , which has received notable visitors such as prince charles .  political representation  okehampton elected two members to the unreformed house of commons . the reform act of 1832 abolished its representation as a rotten borough .  military presence  there is a substantial army training camp on dartmoor which can be reached via okehampton , and is commonly referred to as okehampton camp . it is managed           variety of military units , including the commando training centre royal marines , lympstone , devon , and many cadet training units . the ten tors event is run by the army each year in early may from okehampton camp .  education  schools in the town include okehampton primary school and okehampton college . there are also a number of smaller primary schools in the surrounding areas for children within the catchment area of okehampton that include south tawton , hatherleigh , chagford , north tawton and bridestowe .  sport  the town s football team , okehampton argyle , is a non-league club which was established in 1926 after the original side , okehampton town , disbanded . the club competes in the south west peninsula league which sits at steps 6 and 7 of the national league system ; four leagues below the top division of non-league football , the football conference . the town also has a rugby club , okehampton rfc , which is believed to have been founded in 1884.  travel links  okehampton s location at the edge           route centre . the a30 trunk road now bypasses the town . okehampton railway station is on the former northerly rail route from exeter to plymouth via tavistock . the line from exeter remains open for freight traffic to and from meldon quarry , two miles west of okehampton . in summer , and at weekends throughout the year , the dartmoor railway operates a heritage railway service between okehampton and meldon quarry . in 1997 , devon county council revived a passenger rail service from exeter , on summer weekends only , in an attempt to reduce motor traffic to the national park . as of march 2010 there were plans to reinstate a daily service terminating in exeter . okehampton is served by various bus services from exeter , bude , newquay and tavistock . first bus service x9 links from exeter bus station via exeter st davids to okehampton and then to bude . other services from exeter bus station include the 510 western greyhound service via exeter st davids , which continues to newquay . the exeter to plymouth railway of the lswr           okehampton where the railway line connects via exeter with the rest of the uk railway system on an all weather basis . there are proposals to reopen the line from tavistock to bere alston for a through service to plymouth . on the night of 4 february 2014 , amid high winds and extremely rough seas , part of the sea wall at dawlish was breached washing away around of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind . the line was closed . network rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 april 2014 . in the wake of widespread disruption caused by damage to the mainline track at dawlish by coastal storms in february 2014 , network rail are considering reopening the tavistock to okehampton and exeter section of the line as an alternative to the coastal route .  nearby settlements  okehampton is surrounded by many smaller villages and towns . notable examples are the villages of south zeal with its ancient burgage plots , granite thatched cottages and dartmoor folk festival ; belstone , noted for its location on the very outskirts           the sittaford mystery   ; and sticklepath which has an annual fire show on bonfire night , 5 november . other nearby villages and settlements include folly gate , northlew , jacobstowe , bridestowe and sourton.
transarmament is the partial or total replacement of armed forces with the physical and social infrastructure to support nonviolent resistance . according to an encyclopedia definition , transarmament is  the process of changeover from a military-based defense policy to a civilian-based defense policy . transarmament always involves the replacement of one means to provide defense with another . it therefore differs from disarmament , which is the simple reduction or abandonment of military capacity .   civilian defense  the term transarmament appears to have been introduced in 1937 in a pamphlet by kenneth boulding . it appears not to have been used again until the 1960s . according to adam roberts , : at least four possible stages of transarmament can be envisaged : : 1 . research and investigation into civilian defence , in order to judge its workability , relate it to a specific country s defence problems , and develop strategic and tactical concepts so that the proposal can be presented in concrete and practical terms . : 2           ; concentrated training of key groups and individuals ; organizational preparations . : 3 . application of civilian defence in specific areas without complete abandonment of military defence policy . : 4 . public commitment to use civilian defence in resisting all threats formerly dealt with by military methods . completion of process of transarment.  offensive to defensive  transarmament has later been usedfor example , by johan galtungas a technical term to describe a shift in military strategy . galtung distinguishes between offensive and defense armaments and suggests transitioning to a defensive system of national defense . his use of the term does not imply nonviolence. cite journal
deathplace = london harriet cohen cbe was a british pianist .  biography  harriet cohen was born in london and studied piano at the royal academy of music under tobias matthay , having won the ada lewis scholarship at the age of 12 followed by the sterndale bennett prize in 1913 . she made her debut at a chappell s sunday concert at the queen s hall a year later . her first major appearance was in 1920 when she appeared at the wigmore hall in a joint recital with the tenor john coates . she became particularly associated with contemporary british music , giving the world premiere of ralph vaughan williams  piano concerto and recording edward elgar s piano quintet with the stratton quartet under the composer s supervision . a number of composers wrote music specifically for her , including john ireland , bla bartk , ernest bloch and e. j. moeran , and particularly sir arnold bax , who wrote most of his           david lean s 1948 film version of   oliver twist   . he also composed concertino for left hand for her after she lost the use of her right hand in 1948 . the last six pieces in the collection   mikrokosmos   by bartk are dedicated to her . harriet cohen dedicated an important effort to the performance of the tudor composers at a time when this was unusual , and gave recitals of works by william byrd and orlando gibbons and also of henry purcell . she was considered one of the finest performers of j. s. bach s keyboard music , winning outstanding praise from the musicologist alfred einstein . pablo casals , also , invited her to play bach with his orchestra at barcelona , and wilhelm furtwngler extended a similar invitation on hearing her in switzerland . she gave the first  all-bach  recital at the queen s hall in 1925 . she also cultivated spanish music , and gave the second performance of manuel de falla s   nights in the gardens of spain   , a work           an early exponent of music of the soviet union in britain , and visited russia in 1935 to broadcast from moscow and leningrad , including works by shostakovich , kabalevsky and leonid polovinkin . these composers later sent her further compositions . cohen s influence went well beyond that of a musician . she became strongly associated in the 1930s with publicising the plight of german and austrian jews and even played a concert with the scientist albert einstein in 1934 to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of germany . she became a close friend of eleanor roosevelt and ramsay macdonald as well as the first president of israel , chaim weizmann . cohen was also a close friend of many leading figures of the time . these included not only musicians such as jean sibelius , ralph vaughan williams , sir edward elgar and sir william walton , but also novelists such as arnold bennett , george bernard shaw , h. g. wells and d. h. lawrence as well as politicians or entrepreneurs such as max beaverbrook and leslie viscount runciman . cohen           her day . she was vice-president of the women s freedom league , and was for several years associated with the jewish national fund and the palestine conservatoire of music at jerusalem . cohen was appointed a commander of the order of the british empire in 1938 . she died in london . the harriet cohen international music award was introduced in her honour in 1951 . in january 2006 ,   dearest tania   , a words-and-music programme telling the story of cohen , premiered , written by duncan honeybourne and performed with actress louisa clein.  efforts for refugees from nazism  harriet cohen met the american journalist dorothy thompson in 1930 on her first tour of america , a tour which took in new york , washington and the library of congress and chicago , thus finally establishing a name for herself on the international stage . it was a meeting that was to change cohen s life and awake her jewish consciousness . in 1933 harriet cohen traveled to vienna to play a number of concerts , staying with dorothy thompson .           both jewish and non-jewish , who were pouring into the city from germany . thompson and cohen were to correspond about the plight of jewish refugees in austria and germany . cohen was then able to pass on information from thompson directly to the british prime minister , ramsay macdonald , who was at this time her intimate friend . cohen met thompson every time she went to america thereafter . from 1933 cohen committed herself to work in britain and the united states on behalf of refugees . this would result in a concert in america with albert einstein in 1934 to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of germany . in 1935 ramsay macdonald warned cohen not to travel through germany because the british government would not be able to provide immunity for her . soon after , adolf hitler passed the nuremberg laws totally excluding jews from public life . harriet cohen had met albert einstein in germany in 1929 when she had afternoon tea at his house . at the time einstein disclosed that he played the violin and said that one day they should play           he had fled germany in 1933 . cohen would often visit him in oxford , england where he settled for a short time . in 1934 , after einstein moved to usa , harriet cohen did finally play that duet concert with einstein to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of nazi germany . cohen and einstein remained friends thereafter and he referred to her as the beloved piano witch . it was not until 1939 when she first met chaim weizmann , the future first president of israel , that she began to support the zionist cause and a jewish homeland . cohen s 1939 visit to palestine extended her reputation there both as a concert pianist and politically . she argued with british and jewish officials to try to get jewish refugees admitted on ships from nazi germany , once almost precipitating an international incident . harriet cohen believed passionately in a jewish homeland but with justice to the arab palestinians . she survived two assassination attempts during her trip to palestine . it was when cohen was having dinner with weizmann           government s 1939 white paper to limit jewish immigration to britain to just 15,000 people a year . blanche dugdale , lord balfour s niece , a fellow diner , prophetically said in an agonised voice , what will happen to the millions fleeing from hitler ?  russian composers  the visit in spring 1935 by cohen to the soviet union was another major milestone in her career . it was the country from which her ancestors had fled 100 years earlier . not only was cohen bringing british music to the ussr by playing pieces by vaughan williams , bax , bliss and ireland , she also performed shostakovitch s preludes , kabalevsky s sonatina , and the soviet premiere of leonid polovinkin s suite from manuscript . thereafter she took their music all over europe and was acclaimed as the first musician outside the ussr to learn shostakovitch s twenty-four preludes , which he composed in 1932 and 1933 . her contribution in bringing to the attention of the world the work of unknown russian composers is often forgotten .  relationship with sir arnold bax  one           love love without strife or fret or circumstances just the praise to you . my mouth longs for your soft mouth .. . these are just two quotes from the love letters between sir arnold bax and harriet cohen . harriet cohen s love affair with bax lasted for over forty years until he died in 1953 . it was bax who gave harriet cohen the name tania , by which she was affectionately known by close friends and family . their passionate affair started in 1914 when she was 19 and he was 31 , although they had met two years earlier . bax was creatively inspired by cohen and in 1915 wrote for her within 13 days three pieces including the princess s rose garden , the maiden with the daffodil and in the vodka shop . some believe that their time together inspired his famous tone-poem   tintagel   , in which he may have in part expressed his anguish at the dream their world denied . the affair led to bax s ultimate decision to leave his wife and children in 1918 , but they           a divorce . neither could their relationship be recognised publicly because of the social climate of their generation . cohen possibly became pregnant with bax s child in 1919 but if she did , she lost the child in an early miscarriage . harriet cohen s recently published letters reveal the turbulence and anguish of the relationship . cohen always claimed that the long standing affair denied her becoming a dame , but this is not substantiated . through the 1930s their relationship became less passionate as her international career flourished , and bax sought a quieter haven with his gentler mistress mary gleaves ; nonetheless the affair continued and they remained close , as private letters between cohen and bax reveal . in 1936 , for example , they travelled together to stockholm and helsinki and met jean sibelius , a composer who had long influenced bax s music . on 23 september 1947 , bax s wife elsa died . cohen probably expected to finally marry bax after an affair that had now lasted 30 years . events were to unfold quite differently . bax did           , a fact she was to discover in may 1948 whilst recording the music that bax had written for the film   oliver twist   , when elsa s will was published . a greater shock followed , when bax revealed his secret twenty-year affair with gleaves and his intention not to remarry . this was at a time when cohen was losing prominence in britain , and in may 1948 cohen had an accident with a tray of glasses , which severed the artery in her right hand thus restricting her performing career for some years . when bax died on 3 october 1953 , cohen was deeply affected by his death . his will bequeathed half of his interest from his literary and musical compositions to cohen for life , and half to mary gleaves . after their death his royalties and estate were to pass to his children . cohen also kept the london property that bax had bought for her - throughout cohen s life bax had financially assisted her .  other relationships  the british prime minister ramsay macdonald is one of her           during the period when he was prime minister from 1929 to 1935 , at a time of economic instability and depression which saw the rise of nazism and fascism in europe . it was rumoured that macdonald and cohen became lovers . their letters reflect a closeness ; and she often visited him alone at 10 downing street and his home in hampstead . certainly many people did believe they were lovers and cohen was often referred to as the old man s darling . cohen was also close to max beaverbrook , the founder of express newspapers and an important entrepreneur of the day . cohen was introduced to the business tycoon max beaverbrook by arnold bennett in 1923 . beaverbrook was instantly charmed by cohen and invited her to dine regularly with him from 1923 and through him met lord rothermere and lloyd george . beaverbrook and cohen often met at her house , as noted in her autobiography   a bundle of time   . he was besotted with her in his own way and showered her regularly with a hundred or more roses . ralph           . his letters to her reveal a flirtatious relationship , regularly reminding her of the thousands of kisses that she owed him . he was a regular visitor to her home and often attended cohen s little parties that she held for her friends . she loved entertaining and inviting famous and prominent people . cohen premiered vaughan williams  hymn tune prelude in 1930 which he dedicated to her . she later introduced the piece throughout europe during her concert tours . in 1933 she then premiered his piano concerto in c major , a work which was once again dedicated to her . cohen was given the exclusive right to play the piece for a period of time . harriet cohen first played for edward elgar in 1914 at a party when she was 18 . they became close friends and this lasted until his death in 1934 . in 1933 cohen organised a concert in his honour under the patronage of the king and queen . undoubtedly elgar doted on cohen and closely followed her career , giving her constant support . under elgar s direction she made           quartet . elgar had only sketched it but he gave the short score to harriet for the recording . h. g. wells was part of harriet cohen s circle of male admirers from the 1920s . after wells parted from writer and novelist rebecca west , it is well known that wells took up brief liaisons with other women . harriet cohen is highly likely to have been one of these , as various letters from her private collection and interviews suggest . she had a magnetic personality and beauty which wells found irresistible . d. h. lawrence became a close friend of harriet cohen s . it was clear already in 1915 that this friendship had created some tensions between cohen and arnold bax . bax protested at cohen s closeness to lawrence . she told lawrence that they would have to meet secretly . in demonstrative mood that day , lawrence scrawled across her autograph book the door closed . a short time later cohen contracted tuberculosis , possibly from

a flashtube , also called a flashlamp , is an electric arc lamp designed to produce extremely intense , incoherent , full-spectrum white light for very short durations . flashtubes are made of a length of glass tubing with electrodes at either end and are filled with a gas that , when triggered , ionizes and conducts a high voltage pulse to produce the light . flashtubes are used mostly for photographic purposes but are also employed in scientific , medical and industrial applications .  construction  the lamp comprises a hermetically sealed glass tube , which is filled with a noble gas , usually xenon , and electrodes to carry electrical current to the gas . additionally , a high voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas . a charged capacitor is usually used for this purpose , so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is triggered .  glass envelopes  the glass envelope is most commonly a thin tube , often made of fused quartz , borosilicate or pyrex , which may be straight           including helical , u shape , and circular . in some applications , the emission of ultraviolet light is undesired , whether due to production of ozone , damage to laser rods , degradation of plastics , or other detrimental effects . in these cases , a doped fused silica is used . doping with titanium dioxide can provide different cutoff wavelengths on the ultraviolet side , but the material suffers from solarization ; it is often used in medical and sun-ray lamps and some non-laser lamps . a better alternative is a cerium-doped quartz ; it does not suffer from solarization and has higher efficiency , as part of the absorbed ultraviolet is reradiated as visible via fluorescence . its cutoff is at about 380 nm . conversely , when ultraviolet is called for , a synthetic quartz is used as the envelope ; it is the most expensive of the materials , but it is not susceptible to solarization and its cutoff is at 160 nm . the power level of the lamps is rated in watts/area           . cooling of the electrodes and the lamp envelope is of high importance at high power levels . air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels . high power lamps are cooled with a liquid , typically by flowing demineralized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased . water-cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes , to provide a direct thermal conductor between them and the cooling water . the cooling medium should flow also across the entire length of the lamp and electrodes . high average power or continuous-wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp , and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well , so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit . above 15 w/cm 2 forced air cooling is required ; liquid cooling if in a confined space . liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 w/cm 2 . thinner walls can survive higher average-power loads due to lower mechanical strain across the thickness of the material , which is caused by a           . for this reason , thinner glass is often used for continuous-wave arc-lamps . thicker materials can generally handle more impact energy from the shock wave that a short-pulsed arc can generate , so quartz as much as 1 mm thick is often used in the construction of flashtubes . the material of the envelope provides another limit for the output power ; 1 mm thick fused quartz has a limit of 200 w/cm 2 , synthetic quartz of same thickness can run up to 240 w/cm 2 . aging lamps require some derating , due to increased energy absorption in the glass due to solarization and sputtered deposits .  electrodes and seals  the electrodes protrude into each end of the tube , and are sealed to the glass using a few different methods . ribbon seals use thin strips of molybdenum foil bonded directly to the glass , which are very durable , but are           . solder seals bond the glass to the electrode with a solder for a very strong mechanical seal , but are limited to low temperature operation . most common in laser pumping applications is the rod seal , where the rod of the electrode is wetted with another type of glass and then bonded directly to a quartz tube . this seal is very durable and capable of withstanding very high temperature and currents . the seal and the glass must have the same coefficient of expansion . for low electrode wear the electrodes are usually made of tungsten , which has the highest melting point of any metal , to handle the thermionic emission of electrons . cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound , which gives low work function ; the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application . anodes are usually made from pure tungsten , or , when good machinability is required , lanthanum-alloyed tungsten , and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading . dc arc lamps often have a cathode with           from the glass and to control temperature . flashtubes usually have a cathode with a flattened radius , to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents , which may be in excess of 1000 amperes . electrode design is also influenced by the average power . at high levels of average power , care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes . while anode temperature is of lower importance , overheating the cathode can greatly reduce the lamp s life expectancy .  gases and fill pressure  depending on the size , type , and application of the flashtube , gas fill pressures may range from a few kilopascals to hundreds of kilopascals . generally , the higher the pressure , the greater the output efficiency . xenon is used mostly because of its good efficiency , converting nearly 50% of electrical energy into light . krypton , on the other hand , is only about 40% efficient , but at low currents is a better match to the absorption           is the amount of gas behind the electrodes , or the dead volume . a higher dead volume leads to a lower pressure increase during operation .  operation  the electrodes of the lamp are usually connected to a capacitor , which is charged to a relatively high voltage , using a step up transformer and a rectifier . the gas , however , exhibits extremely high resistance , and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized . once ionized , or triggered , a spark will form between the electrodes , allowing the capacitor to discharge . the sudden surge of electric current quickly heats the gas to a plasma state , where electrical resistance becomes very low . there are several methods of triggering .  external triggering  external triggering is the most common method of operation , especially for photographic use . the electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering , but below the lamp s self-flash threshold . an extremely high voltage pulse , the short , high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field , which ionizes the gas inside the tube . the capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope , where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding one or both of the electrodes , forming spark streamers . the streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds . the triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a reference plane , which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass , a conductive paint , or a thin wire           capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode , when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas , heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light .  series triggering  series triggering is more common in high powered , water-cooled flashtubes , such as those found in lasers . the high voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series , . the trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp , without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp . the advantages are better insulation , more reliable triggering , and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass , but at a much higher cost . the series triggering transformer also acts as an inductor . this helps to control the flash duration , but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications . the triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at           , the trigger-transfromer becomes part of the flash circuit , and couples the triggering circuit to the flash energy . therefore , because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance , the transformer , triggering circuit , and silicon controlled rectifier must be able to handle very high peak currents , often in excess of 1500 amps.  simmer voltage triggering  simmer voltage triggering is the least common method . in this technique , the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes , but instead , a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes . the high current from the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap . this type of triggering is used mainly in very fast rise time systems , typically those that discharge in the microsecond regime , such as used in high speed stop-motion photography or dye lasers . the simmering spark streamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp , increasing the lifetime dramatically . if external triggering is used , the spark streamers may still be in           through the tube , causing wall ablation , or in extreme cases , cracking or even explosion of the lamp . however , because very short pulses often call for very high voltage and low capacitance , keeping the current density from rising too high , some microsecond flashtubes are triggered by simply over-volting , that is , by applying a voltage to the electrodes which is much higher than the lamp s self-flash threshold , using a spark gap . often , a combination of simmer voltage and over-volting is used .  prepulse techniques  very rapid rise-times are often achieved using a prepulse technique . this method is performed by delivering a small flash through the lamp just before the main flash . this flash is of much lower energy than the main flash and , depending on the pulse duration , is delivered just a few thousandths to a few millionths of a second before the main flash . the prepulse heats the gas , leaving a good quantity of ionized particles to be used by the main flash . this           wave and makes less noise during operation , vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp . it is especially effective on very fast discharge applications , allowing the arc to expand faster and better fill the tube . it is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering , but rarely used with external triggering . prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping of dye lasers , greatly increasing the conversion efficiency . however , it has also been shown to increase the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes , such as nd:yag or titanium sapphire , by creating pulses with almost square waveforms .  ablative flashtubes  ablative flashtubes are triggered by under-pressurizing . ablative flashtubes are typically constructed using quartz tubing and one or both electrodes hollowed out , allowing a vacuum pump to be attached to control the gas pressure . the electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capacitor , and then the gas is vacuumed from the lamp . when the gas reaches a low enough pressure large amounts of quartz from the inner wall . this ablation creates a sudden , violent increase in the internal pressure of the lamp , increasing the efficiency of the flash to very high levels . the ablation , however , causes extensive wear to the lamp , weakening the glass , and they typically need replacement after a very short lifetime . ablative flashtubes need to be refilled and vacuumed to the proper pressure for each flash . therefore , they can not be used for very high-repetition applications . also , this usually precludes the use of very expensive gases like krypton or xenon . the most common gas used in an ablative flashtube is air , although sometimes cheap argon is also used . the           heat from transferring to the glass , but the flashes can often be shorter than a normal lamp of comparative size . the flash from a single ablative flashtube can also be more intense than multiple lamps . for these reasons , the most common use for the lamps is for the pumping of dye lasers .  variable pulse width control  in addition , an insulated-gate bipolar transistor can be connected in series with both the trigger transformer and the lamp , making adjustable flash durations possible . an igbt used for this purpose must be rated for a high pulsed current , so as to avoid over-current damage to the semiconductor junction . this type of system is used frequently in high average power laser systems , and can produce pulses ranging from 500 microseconds to over 20 milliseconds . it can be used with any of the triggering techniques , like external and series , and can produce square wave pulses . it can even be used with simmer voltage to produce a modulated continuous wave output , with repetition rates over 300 hertz           several kilowatts of average power output can be obtained .  electrical requirements  the electrical requirements for a flashtube can vary , depending on the desired results . the usual method , once maximum power and the safe amount of operating energy is determined , is to pick a current density that will emit the desired spectrum , and let the lamp s resistance determine the necessary combination of voltage and capacitance to produce it . the resistance in flashtubes varies greatly , depending on pressure , shape , dead volume , current density , time , and flash duration , and therefore , is usually referred to as impedance . the most common symbol used for lamp impedance is k o , which is expressed as ohms . k o is determined by the internal diameter , arc length , and gas type of the lamp and , to a lesser extent , by fill pressure . the resistance in flashtubes is not constant , but quickly drops as current density increases . in 1965 , goncz showed that           square root of current density . as the arc develops , the lamp experiences a period of negative resistance , causing the resistance to decrease as the current increases . this occurs until the plasma comes into contact with the inner wall . when this happens , the voltage becomes proportional to the square root of current , and the resistance in the plasma becomes stable for the remainder of the flash . it is this value which is defined as k o . however , as the arc develops the gas expands , and calculations for k o do not take into account the dead volume , which leads to a lower pressure increase . therefore , any calculation of k o is merely an approximation of lamp impedance.  output spectrum   xenon  a xenon flash lamp is a gas-discharge lamp that contains xenon gas . these lamps have three leads : an anode , a cathode , and a trigger-voltage lead . when a certain voltage is applied to the trigger lead , xenon gas ionizes and displays a bright           voltage is applied across the anode and cathode leads , xenon gas will not ionize . the use of a xenon flash lamp may be suitable for photographing or lightning projects . as with all ionized gases , xenon flashtubes emit light in various spectral lines . this is the same phenomenon that gives neon signs their characteristic color . however , neon signs emit red light because of extremely low current densities when compared to those seen in flashtubes , which favors spectral lines of longer wavelengths . higher current densities tend to favor shorter wavelengths . the light from xenon , in a neon sign , likewise is rather violet . the spectrum emitted by flashtubes is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type . low current densities produce spectral line emission , against a faint background of continuous radiation . xenon has many spectral lines in the uv , blue , green , red , and ir portions of the spectrum . low current densities produce a greenish-blue flash , indicating the absence of significant yellow or orange lines . at           be directed into the invisible ir spectral lines around 820 , 900 , and 1000 nm . low current densities for flashtubes are generally less than 1000 a/cm 2 . higher current densities begin to produce continuum emission . spectral lines are less dominant as light is produced across the spectrum , usually peaking , or centered , on a certain wavelength . optimum output efficiency in the visual range is obtained at a density that favors greybody radiation . for xenon , greybody radiation is centered near green , and produces the right combination for white light . greybody radiation is produced at densities above 2400 a/cm 2 . current densities that are very high , approaching 4000 a/cm 2 , tend to favor black-body radiation . as current densities become even higher , xenon s output spectrum will begin to settle on that of a blackbody radiator with a color temperature of 9800 kelvins . blackbody           radiation from within the arc can be absorbed before reaching the surface , impairing output efficiency . due to its high efficient white output , xenon is used extensively for photographic applications , despite its great expense . in lasers , spectral line emission is usually favored , as these lines tend to better match absorption lines of the lasing media . krypton is also occasionally used , although it is even more expensive . at low current densities , krypton s spectral line output in the near-ir range is better matched to the absorption profile of neodymium based laser media than xenon emission , and very closely matches the narrow absorption profile of nd:yag.  krypton and other gases  all gases produce spectral lines which are specific to the gas , superimposed on a background of continuum radiation . with all gases , low current densities produce mostly spectral lines , with the highest output being concentrated in the near-ir between 650 and 1000 nm . krypton s strongest peaks are around 760 and 810 nm . argon has many strong peaks at 670 , 710 , 760 ,           peaks around 650 , 700 , 850 , and 880 nm . as current densities become higher , the output of continuum radiation will increase more than the spectral line radiation at a rate 20% greater , and output center will shift toward the visual spectrum . at greybody current densities there is only a slight difference in the spectrum emitted by various gases . at very high current densities , all gases will begin to operate as blackbody radiators , with spectral outputs centered in the near-uv . heavier gases exhibit higher resistance , and therefore , have a higher value for k o . impedance , being defined as the resistance required to change energy into work , is higher for heavier gases , and as such , the heavier gases are much more efficient than the lighter ones . helium and neon are far too light to produce an efficient flash . krypton can be as good as 40% efficient , but requires up to a 70% increase in pressure to achieve this . argon can be up to 30% efficient , but requires an even           voltage drop between the electrodes , formed by the spark streamer , may be greater than the capacitor voltage . these lamps often need a boost voltage during the trigger phase , to overcome the extremely high trigger impedance . nitrogen , in the form of air , has been used in flashtubes in home made dye lasers , but the nitrogen and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes , and themselves , causing premature wear and the need to adjust the pressure for each flash . some research has been done on mixing gases to alter the spectral output . the effect on the output spectrum is negligible , but the effect on efficiency is great . adding a lighter gas will only reduce the efficiency of the heavier one .  light production  as the current pulse travels through the tube , it ionizes the atoms , causing them to jump to higher energy levels . three types of particles are found within the arc plasma , consisting of electrons , positively ionized atoms , and neutral atoms . at any given time , the ionized           produce all of the emitted light . as they recombine with their lost electrons they immediately drop back to a lower energy state , releasing photons in the process . the methods of transferring energy occur in three separate ways , called bound-bound , free-bound , and free-free transitions . within the plasma , positive ions move toward the cathode while electrons and neutral atoms move toward the anode . bound-bound transitions occur when the ions and neutral atoms collide , transferring an electron from the atom to the ion . this method predominates at low current densities , and is responsible for producing the spectral line emission . free-bound transitions happen when an ion captures a free electron . this method produces the continuum emission , and is more prominent at higher current densities . some of the continuum is also produced when an electron accelerates toward an ion , called free-free transitions , producing bremsstrahlung radiation .  intensity and duration of flash  the only real electrical limit to how short a pulse can be is the total-system inductance , including that of the capacitor , wires ,           be minimized . this is typically done using special capacitors , the shortest wires available , and electrical-leads with a lot of surface area but thin cross-sections . for extremely fast systems , low-inductance axial-leads , such as copper tubing , plastic-core wires , or even hollowed electrodes , may be used to decrease the total-system inductance . dye lasers need very short pulses and sometimes use axial flashtubes , which have an annular shape with a large outer diameter , ring-shaped electrodes , and a hollow inner core , allowing both lower inductance and a dye cell to be placed like an axle through the center of the lamp . in contrast , changes in the input voltage or capacitance have no effect on discharge time , although they do have an effect on current density . as flash duration decreases , the electrical energy becomes concentrated into shorter pulses , so the current density will increase . compensating for this usually requires lowering the capacitance as pulse duration decreases , and then raising the voltage proportionately in order to maintain a high enough energy-level . however , as pulse           the lamp , so the energy level must also be decreased to avoid destroying the lamp . the amount of power loading the glass can handle is the major mechanical limit . even if the amount of energy that is used remains constant , electrical power will increase in inverse proportion to a decrease in discharge time . therefore , energy must be decreased along with the pulse duration , to keep the pulsed power levels from rising too high . quartz glass can usually withstand a maximum of 160 watts per square centimeter of internal surface-area . other glasses have a much lower threshold . extremely fast systems , with inductance below critical damping , usually require a shunt diode across the capacitor , to prevent current reversal from destroying the lamp . if the pulse is allowed to ring through the lamp it will lengthen the flash , so the diode traps the ringing , allowing the lamp shut down at the correct time . the limits           to the anode , sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode , and the temperature gradients of the glass . pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode , while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise . for continuous operation the cooling is the limit . discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds , and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz . flash duration can be carefully controlled with the use of an inductor . the flash that emanates from a xenon flashtube may be so intense that it can ignite flammable materials within a short distance of the tube . carbon nanotubes are particularly susceptible to this spontaneous ignition when exposed to the light from a flashtube . similar effects may be exploited for use in aesthetic or medical procedures known as intense pulsed light treatments . ipl can be used for treatments such as hair removal and destroying lesions or moles.  lifetime  the lifetime of a flashtube depends on both the energy level used for the           the pulse duration of the lamp . failures can be catastrophic , causing the lamp to shatter , or they can be gradual , reducing the performance of the lamp below a usable rating .  catastrophic failure  catastrophic failure can occur from two separate mechanisms : energy and heat . when too much energy is used for the pulse duration , structural failure of the glass envelope can occur . flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube . as the arc develops a supersonic shock-wave forms , traveling radially from the center of the arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube . if the energy level is low enough , a soft tap against the glass is all that will be heard . however , if the energy level used equals the explosion energy rating of the lamp , the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass , rupturing the tube . the resulting explosion creates a loud , sonic shock-wave , and may throw shattered glass several feet . the explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp           the glass . power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass , and the cooling method that is used . power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared . however , since the pulsed-power level increases as the flash duration decreases , the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time . failure from heat is usually caused by excessively long pulse durations or high average power levels . when the inner wall of the tube gets too hot while the outer wall is still cold , this temperature gradient can cause the lamp to crack . similarly , if the electrodes heat much faster than the glass , the lamp may crack or even shatter at the ends .  gradual failure  the closer a flashtube operates to its explosion energy , the greater the risk becomes for catastrophic failure . at 50% of the explosion energy , the lamp may produce several thousand flashes before exploding . at 60% of the explosion energy , the lamp will usually fail in less than a hundred .           energy the risk of catastrophic failure becomes very low . the methods of failure then become those that reduce the output efficiency and affect the ability to trigger the lamp . the processes affecting these are sputter and ablation of the inner wall . sputter occurs when the energy level is very low , below 15% of the explosion energy , or when the pulse duration is very long . sputter is the vaporization of metal from the cathode , which is redeposited on the walls of the lamp , blocking the light output . since the cathode is more emissive than the anode , the flashtube is polarized , and connecting the lamp to the power source incorrectly will quickly ruin it . however , even if connected properly , the degree of sputter may vary considerably from lamp to lamp . therefore , it is impossible to predict the lifetime accurately at low energy levels . at higher energy levels , wall ablation becomes the main process of wear . the electrical arc slowly erodes the inner wall of the tube , forming microscopic cracks that give the glass           glass , increasing the pressure beyond an operable level . this causes triggering problems , known as jitter . however , at higher energy levels the lifetime can be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy . when operated below 30% of the explosion energy , flashtube lifetime is generally between a few million to tens of millions of flashes .  applications  as the duration of the flash that is emitted by a xenon flashtube can be accurately controlled , and due to the high intensity of the light , xenon flashtubes are commonly used as photographic strobe lights . xenon flashtubes are also used in very high speed or stop-motion photography , which was pioneered by harold edgerton in the 1930s . because they can generate bright attention-getting flashes with a relatively small continuous input of electrical power , they are also used in aircraft warning lights , emergency vehicle lighting , fire alarm annunciator devices , aircraft anticollision beacons , and other similar applications . in dentistry it is used in so called light box device to light activate           materials due to their high-intensity and relative brightness at short wavelengths and short pulse widths , flashtubes are also ideally suited as light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states where they can subsequently be stimulated to emit coherent monochromatic light . proper selection of the filler gas is crucial here , so the maximum of radiated output energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the lasing medium ; e.g. krypton flashtubes are more suitable than xenon flashtubes for pumping nd:yag lasers , as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of nd:yag . xenon flashtubes have been used to produce an intense flash of white light , some of which is absorbed by nd:glass that produces the laser power for inertial confinement fusion . in total about 1 to 1.5% of the electrical power fed into the flashtubes is turned into useful laser light for this application .  history  the flashtube was invented by harold edgerton in           moving objects . flashtubes were mainly used for strobe lights in scientific studies , but eventually began to take the place of chemical and powder flash lamps in mainstream photography . early high-speed photographs were taken with an open-air electrical arc discharge , called spark photography . the earliest known use of spark photography began with henry fox talbot around 1850 . in 1886 , ernst mach used an open air spark to photograph a speeding bullet , revealing the shockwaves it produced at supersonic speeds . open air spark systems were fairly easy to build , but were bulky , very limited in light output , and produced loud noises comparable to that of a gunshot . in 1927 , harold edgerton built his first flash unit while at massachusetts institute of technology . wanting to photograph the motion of a motor in vivid detail , without blur , edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mercury-arc rectifier instead of an open air discharge to produce the light . he was able to achieve a flash duration of 10 microseconds , and was able to           his colleague s interest in the new flash apparatus soon provoked edgerton to improve upon the design . the mercury lamp s efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp , causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold . edgerton decided to try a noble gas , feeling that it would not be as temperature dependent as mercury , and , in 1930 , he employed the general electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead . the argon tubes were much more efficient , compact , and could be mounted near a reflector , concentrating their output . slowly , camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it . edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the kodak company in 1940 . afterward , he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases , producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight , and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets . it was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use           invented the ruby laser , a new demand for flashtubes began for use in lasers , and new interest was taken in the study of the lamps .  safety  flashtubes operate at high voltages , with currents high enough to be deadly . under certain conditions , shocks as low as 1 joule have been reported to be lethal . the energy stored in a capacitor can remain surprisingly long after power has been disconnected . a flashtube will usually shut down before the capacitor has fully drained , and it may regain part of its charge through a process called dielectric absorption . in addition , the charging system itself can be equally deadly . the trigger voltage can deliver a painful shock , usually not enough to kill , but which can often startle a person into bumping or touching something more dangerous . when a person is charged to high voltages a spark can jump , delivering the high capacitor current without actually touching anything . flashtubes operate at high pressures and are known to explode , producing violent shockwaves . the explosion energy of a           in just a few flashes ) is well defined , and to avoid catastrophic failure , it is recommended that no more than 30% of the explosion energy be used . flashtubes should be shielded behind glass or in a reflector cavity . if not , eye and ear protection should be worn . flashtubes produce very intense flashes , often faster than the eye can register , and may not appear as bright as they are . quartz glass will transmit nearly all of the long and short wave uv , including the germicidal wavelengths , and can be a serious hazard to eyes and skin . this ultraviolet radiation can also produce large amounts of ozone , which can be harmful to people , animals , and equipment . many compact cameras charge the flash

stoke mandeville hospital is a large national health service hospital in the district of aylesbury vale and the town of aylesbury , near the village of stoke mandeville in buckinghamshire . it is part of buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust . the hospital s national spinal injuries centre is one of the largest specialist spinal units in the world , and the pioneering rehabilitation work carried out there by sir ludwig guttmann led to the development of the paralympic games . mandeville , one of the official mascots for the 2012 summer olympics and paralympics in london , was named in honour of the hospital s contribution to paralympic sports .  history  in the early 1830s the village of stoke mandeville was badly affected by cholera epidemics that swept across england . a cholera hospital was established on the parish border between stoke mandeville and aylesbury . it was founded with monies provided by both parishes , but was built separately from both places as cholera was very contagious and the inhabitants were anxious to avoid infection . by the start of the twentieth century the hospital           infections , not just cholera . however the town of aylesbury was growing , and the distance between the town and the hospital was getting smaller , and before long people with infectious diseases could no longer be treated at the hospital because the risk of infecting the local community was too great . during the second world war the hospital was used to treat military casualties , and was expanded during this time to cater for the extra patients , so as to support the nearby royal bucks hospital , in the centre of aylesbury . it was during this time that spinal injuries were first treated at the hospital . in 1948 the nhs was founded and all operations were moved from the royal bucks to stoke mandeville , making it the main hospital in aylesbury . aylesbury had , by this time , grown to such an extent that the hospital became a part of the town . on the day of the opening of the 1948 summer olympics in london , stoke mandeville hospital organised a sports competition for british world war two veteran patients with spinal           same location in 1952 , and dutch veterans took part alongside the british , making it the first international competition of its kind . these stoke mandeville games have been described as the precursors of the paralympic games . the paralympics were subsequently officialised as a quadrennial event tied to the olympic games , and the first official paralympic games , no longer open solely to war veterans , were held in rome in 1960 . throughout the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s the hospital was added to extensively and the new accident and emergency unit was opened . also during this period stoke mandeville stadium was developed alongside the hospital and is the national centre for disability sport in the united kingdom , enhancing the hospital as a world centre for paraplegics and spinal injuries . in the 1970s and 1980s the hospital received support from its biggest campaigner jimmy savile who gave it a high profile on his television appearances , and raised an immense amount of money for the hospital . he was knighted for the amount of time he donated . the hospital was also visited during           princess of wales , who opened the new international spinal injuries centre when it was refurbished . today the hospital is still growing , with a new maternity unit opened in 2009 , and plans to refurbish the accident and emergency unit and further extend the hospital . new wings have been built in recent years . these have been funded by the private finance initiative . the pfi is a scheme where the government contract a private company to design , build , finance and manage a hospital , school , prison or other public service . the company that does this is usually given a 30 year contract . the company that is contracted at stoke mandeville hospital is the multinational sodexho . sodexho is also contracted to provide housekeeping , domestics , catering , vending , portering , non-emergency patient transport , telecommunications , car parking , security , maintenance , help desk and switchboard . all of the portering , catering , domestic , maintenance , security and help desk staff are employed by sodexho rather than the nhs trust .            historic sexual abuse at the hospital  dr michael salmon , consultant paediatrician at stoke mandeville hospital , was convicted and jailed for three years in 1990 for indecent assaults on teenaged girl patients , two thirteen year olds and one sixteen year old girl . the joint metropolitan police service and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children report of the investigations into sexual abuse committed by disc jockey jimmy savile found that savile , who was a valued fundraiser for the institution , committed offences there between 1965 and 1988 . twenty-two offences there between those dates have been formally recorded as crimes by the police . a former child patient at the hospital has said that nurses warned her to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when savile was due to visit .  criticism  on 27 february 2013 , buckinghamshire disability charity buds announced that it was compiling a dossier of evidence about risks to patient safety at stoke mandeville hospital to send to the care quality commission . the charity claimed that it had received alarming reports from various sources           . bucks healthcare nhs trust responded by saying it was somewhat irresponsible of buds to potentially worry patients by hinting at patient safety issues at the hospital . the charity , however , defended its action and said buds wanted to give staff , patients and visitors at stoke mandeville hospital a wholly anonymous way to report any concerns they might have . on 20 april 2013 the cqc published a report after an unannounced inspection at the hospital . it found that the hospital did not meet the standards for staffing levels and for providing support to staff . enforcement action was taken regarding supporting staff and a warning notice was served .  facilities  the table above shows the adult wards at stoke mandeville hospital stoke mandeville hospital hopes to help educate children in first aid and runs regular school tours . stoke mandeville hospital radio is located within the hospital complex and provides a 24 hour radio service to the patients and staff .  transport links  the hospital is served by the london to aylesbury line and the princes risborough to aylesbury line from aylesbury           with aylesbury and high wycombe run by arriva and also with leighton buzzard .

years on hunger strike . in 1994 , he was elected leader of the legalized opposition democratic progressive party . he was also elected legislator in three occasions . shih s proposal of a political grand reconciliation in taiwan earned him strong rejection from within the democratic progressive party , to which he resigned on november 14 , 2000 . in 2006 , shih carried out a massive protest , known as million voices against corruption , president chen must go , in an effort to force the embattled president chen shui-bian to resign . he led an around the clock sit-in in           taipei

shih was roughened up and suffered loss of his teeth and his back spine was damaged at age of 22 . the kuomintang regime considered outspoken shih as highly dangerous political criminal and therefore prevented him from doing any forced labor that would put him in contact with the world outside prison . this           shih focused on philosophy , history , international law , linguistics and japanese . he also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison . in the 1970s , taiwan government suffered several blows to its international status : first , its seat at the united nations was taken over by the people s republic of china , then the united states established official ties with beijing , severing those with taipei . a rebellion in the taiyuan prison , where many of the inmates were political prisoners , was planned . access to the taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast a declaration of taiwan s independence from china was one of their goals . many all pro-independence prisoners took part in the plot . on february 8 , 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun . ultimately the five inmates broke from prison , only to be caught promptly . the breakout plot was foiled . the kuomintang believed shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising , therefore kept him in isolation during his time in taiyuan . to this date ,           of shih is disputed by shih himself , who sued lin shu-chi for defamation . in 1974 , after 12 years of imprisonment , shih s first wife chen li-chu asked for divorce : she had an affair with one of

similar to today s communist chinese government policy to oppose speaking out . the two obscure political parties in taiwan which had no voice . after chiang ching-kuo narrowly missed the assassination from the independence in new york . the nationalists were sensitive to the threats . shih ming-te , created a party without a name amidst the absence of freedom of association in taiwan at that time . on           non-kuomintang candidates . on may 1979 this group of non-kuomintang activists established the meilitao magazine , shih was named general manager . on december 10 , 1979 , this tangwai group commemorates human rights day in kaohsiung . the rally operated without prior approval with specific stipulation that no torches and weapons were allowed . it was intervened by police which clashed with the protestors resulted in damages . the event will be known as the meilitao incident , a milestone in taiwan s democratization process . three days later , shih dramatically escapes : chang wen-ying performs plastic surgery on shih to change his looks so he can escape to overseas . shih was still later caught along with the dentist sentenced to life in prison for the second time . during the 1980 meilitao incident trials shih is defiant and proud facing a potentially fatal court martial decision . he declares during his defense : taiwan should be independent , in fact , it already is , it has been for 30 years and currently it is known           to the political monopoly by the kuomintang , the press control in taiwan and the martial law , so that the 30-plus-year rubber stamped legislative session can be dissolved .  second imprisonment and hunger strike : 1980-1990  in 1983 , one of the allies of shih , professor chen wen-cheng is murdered ; shih ming-te begins a 1-month hunger strike to protest what he believed to be an assassination ordered by the secret police . in 1984 , polish union leader lech wasa nominates shih ming-te for the 1984

the presidency and orders a special amnesty for all meilitao incident prisoners . shih rips up his amnesty document and demands an unconditional release . when president lee announces the invalidation

time representing a taipei city constituency . he will continue his efforts for the completion of the meilitao oral history records . in three years , 200 individuals of the political spectrum . the oral testimonies amount to over 6 million words , and are edited to a 600,000 word four volume version . to date , this is the most comprehensive historical research of the 19701990 era in taiwan s development , earning it a publishing prize . this was the result of shih s individual efforts , using his own financial and personal resources . neither the democratic progressive party nor the government of taiwan have helped complete this overwhelming historic research project . in 2000 , chen shui-bian , the former mayor of taipei city , is elected president . shih congratulates the

as mayor candidate for kaohsiung city . his platform : turn the port-city into a free port , much like hong kong or amsterdam , to cope with the challenge of globalization . direct maritime links with chinese ports was also part of the proposal . shih perceived that the political divide was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election . on september 2003 , shih ming-te is visiting scholar at george mason university for a one-year period . during his tenure , shih researched what he called the one china : european union model as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the taiwan strait , and reiterates his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system , in an attempt to put an end to the political

hundred thousand . on september 22 , 2006 , shih ming-te           nor participate in any political negotiations , he also made it clear that he was not willing to engage in negotiations with former

2007 , the elections will instead be carried out in early 2008.  controversy  shih is often considered a romantic revolutionary in taiwan media . he believes that he is rooted in his ability to to pursue unlimited aspirations and ideals under restrictive conditions . the latest editions of taiwan s high-school textbooks list shih ming-te as a political activist . shih s former legislative yuan secretary , cartoonist and writer yu-fu thinks shih is never quite sure of his own place in history . shih is accused by his ex-wife chen , li zhu , in her book , the innocent song of a taiwanese woman , of using her as a sex toy , and failing his responsibility as a husband . chen also claimed shih been indifferent to his responsibility toward their daughter . shih ming-te often says : i have been locked up for 25 years , where were you then ? . another former secretary of shih , kuo wen-pin , wrote about his opinion of shih on taiwan daily . risking death penalty , shih advocated for a republic of china , taiwanese independence model , and added that taiwan is already an independent country , it has been so for over 30 years . for his opinions , shih was considered seditious and the media , organizations , academia , everyone attacked him and humiliated him , only for the democratic progressive party to adopt and implement his ideas ; they even led the way to lee teng-hui s silent revolution political compromises . when the kuomintang s 50 years in power ended , the chen shui-bian administration accepted some of his teachings . arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism , but the abuse           humiliate , and swear at others is still common practice . ddp party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means has yet remain to be seen . in the aftermath of shih s red-shirt movement , he became a darling of prc controlled media , including cctvphoenix tv , and people s daily . shih s efforts in discrediting the dpp are widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the chinese government . on november 20 , 2006 , ifeng.com , web portal of pro-ccp television channel phoenix tv , reported shih planned a trip to thailand to discuss his red shirt philosophy . in the same article , shih also rebutted claims by representative of the american institute in taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval . on january 16 , 2010 , on april 19 , 2010 , www.chinataiwan.org , a chinese government sponsored site , reported shih claimed numerous prominent ddp leaders , including shui bian chen and chang ting hsieh , were undercover agents for the kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s . according           accusations have caused a general panic in the ddp . a former supporter and pastor of the presbyterian church , wang , jie nan , wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with shih , starting from shih s red shirt movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the dpp with outlandish accusations . on april 17 , 2011 , shih courted controversy when he asked tsai ing-wen to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid . despite his own support for lgbt rights in taiwan , shih was roundly criticized by major women s groups including the awakening foundation , the taiwan women s link and the taiwan gender equity education association . tsai herself characterized the request as surprising and refused

andr de gouveia was a portuguese humanist and pedagogue during the renaissance . andr de gouveia became one of the first portuguese to study in the collge sainte-barbe , in paris , which was then directed by his uncle diogo de gouveia . after attending six years in   maitrise des arts   he earned a degree as doctor in theology , and simultaneously , began teaching at the college . starting in 1530 , due to the many diplomatic missions that kept his uncle away , andr was entrusted by him with the direction of the collge . as an adept of the most advanced religious ideas , andr de gouveia bent saint barbe into the humanist ideals . there in 1531 he appointed regent nicolas cop . after cop s contested inaugural address as rector of the university in 1533 , he was appointed rector of the university of paris for the college of arts , introducing new rules for transparency and fairness among all disciplines , but soon           the college of guienne , in bordeaux . he had been invited by the municipal authorities , and was given full freedom to modernize the old college . on arrival , gouveia proclaimed that he would not recognize differences of creed in staff and pupils , many of whom showed sympathy to the new doctrines of the reform . there , in 1539 , gouveia welcomed george buchanan , appointing him professor of latin . gouveia s stay at the college de guyenne lasted until 1547 , attracting students like tienne de la botie and michel de montaigne , who later in his   essays   described gouveia as ... behind comparison the greatest principal in france . the fame of the teaching -mainly grammar , classical literature , history and philosophy - was such that , in 1552 , italian scholar and physician julius caesar scaliger sent his sons to the college , including joseph justus scaliger . andr de gouveia returned to portugal at the invitation of king john iii , accompanied by a group of foreign teachers , to head the new college of the arts           , buchanan , jernimo osrio , nicolas de grouchy , guillaume gurante and lie vinet , who came to be decisive for the disclosure of contemporary research of pedro nunes . however , gouveia did not remained for long in office as president of the college , as he died in june 1548 . rivalry between the secular trends of the new bordeaux teachers , and the more orthodox method of the parisian school headeds by diogo de gouveia led to several teachers , including george buchanan , to face inquisition : gouveia kept numerous contacts with european scholars and portuguese businesses when he was in france . at odds with his uncle diogo , andr was suspected of lutheranism . he left a few written texts , in particular his views are represented regulations of the collge de guyenne , published by elie vinet in 1583 under the title   schola aquitanica   . andr de gouveia was brother to humanist and teacher antnio de gouveia.

the easterlin hypothesis states that the positive relationship between income and fertility is dependent on relative income . the hypothesis as formulated by richard easterlin presumes that material aspirations are determined by experiences rooted in family background : he assumes first that young couples try to achieve a standard of living equal to or better than they had when they grew up . this is called relative status . if income is high relative to aspirations and jobs are plentiful , it will be easier to marry young and have more children and still match that standard of living . but when jobs are scarce , couples who try to keep that standard of living will wait to get married and have fewer children . children are normal goods once this influence of family background is controlled . for easterlin , the size of the cohort is a critical determinant of how easy it is to get a good job . a small cohort means less competition , a large cohort means more competition to worry about . the assumptions blend economics

birthplace = hampshire , england deathplace = canynge road , clifton , bristol , england * writtle college * university of gloucestershire joanna clare jo yeates was a 25-year-old landscape architect from hampshire , england , who went missing on 17 december 2010 in bristol after an evening out with colleagues . following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries , her body was discovered on 25 december 2010 in failand , north somerset . a post-mortem examination determined that she had been strangled . the murder inquiry , named operation braid , was one of the largest police investigations ever undertaken in the bristol area . the case dominated news coverage in the united kingdom around the christmas period as yeates  family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences . rewards amounting to 60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for yeates  death . the police initially suspected and arrested christopher jefferies , yeates  landlord , who lived in a flat in the           , a 32-year-old dutch engineer and neighbour of yeates , was arrested on 20 january 2011 . media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the bbc s programme ,   crimewatch   . after two days of questioning , he was charged on 22 january 2011 with yeates  murder . on 5 may 2011 , tabak pleaded guilty to yeates  manslaughter , but denied murdering her . his trial started on 4 october 2011 ; he was found guilty of murder on 28 october 2011 , and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years . the nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to the instigation of legal proceedings against a number of uk newspapers . libel action was brought by jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest , resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages . the   daily mirror   and   the sun   were found guilty of contempt of court for reporting information that could prejudice a trial           parish church in the bristol suburb where she lived ; her funeral took place near the family home in hampshire . several memorials were planned , including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in bristol .  background and disappearance  joanna clare yeates was born on 19 april 1985 to david and teresa yeates in hampshire , england . she was privately educated at embley park near romsey . yeates studied for her a-levels at peter symonds college and graduated with a degree in landscape architecture from writtle college . she received her postgraduate diploma in landscape architecture from the university of gloucestershire . in december 2008 , yeates met then-25-year-old fellow landscape architect greg reardon at the firm hyland edgar driver in winchester . the couple moved in together in 2009 and settled in clifton , bristol , when the company relocated to that area . yeates later changed jobs to work at the building design partnership in bristol . at approximately 8:00 pm on 19 december 2010 , reardon returned home from a weekend visit to sheffield to find yeates absent from           been trying to contact her by phone and text , but did not find it .. completely out of character .. that she did not respond . while awaiting yeates  return , reardon found that her purse and keys were at the flat , and that their cat appeared to have been neglected . after he called her again , her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat , which was still in the flat . around midnight , reardon contacted the police and then yeates  parents to report her missing . investigators subsequently pieced together the sequence of events leading up to her disappearance . they determined yeates had spent the evening of 17 december 2010 with colleagues at the bristol ram pub on park street , leaving at around 8:00 pm to begin the 20-minute walk home . she told friends and colleagues that she was looking forward to spending the weekend alone ; she planned to spend her time baking and shopping for christmas . yeates was seen on closed-circuit television at around 8:10 pm leaving a waitrose supermarket without purchasing           , at 8:30 pm to arrange a meeting on christmas eve . the last known footage of yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of tesco express at around 8:40 pm . she had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-license , bargain booze .  search , public appeal , and discovery of body  reardon and yeates  friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her . on 21 december 2010 , yeates  parents and reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference . in another press conference , broadcast live on 23 december 2010 by sky news and bbc news , yeates  father david commented on her disappearance : i think she was abducted after getting home to her flat .. i have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind .. i feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere . her keys , phone , purse           retrieved a receipt for a pizza , but found no sign of it or of its packaging . both bottles of cider were found in the flat , one of them partially consumed . as there was no evidence of forced entry or a struggle , investigators began to examine the possibility that yeates may have known her abductor . on 25 december 2010 , a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along longwood lane near a golf course and next to the entrance of a quarry in failand , approximately from her home . the body was identified by police as that of yeates . reardon and the yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 december 2010 . david yeates said that the family had been told to prepare for the worst and expressed relief that his daughter s body had been recovered . funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators wished to retain the body for a while . the pathologist dr nat carey consented to the release of the body on 31 january 2011.  investigation  the           civilian staff under the direction of detective chief inspector phil jones , a senior officer with avon and somerset constabulary s major crime investigation unit . it became one of the largest police operations in the constabulary s history . jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer , especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of longwood lane in failand in the period before yeates  body was discovered . he stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a light-coloured 4x4 vehicle for questioning . jones said that officers had been .. inundated with thousands of calls .. and were .. exhausting every lead and avenue that they were provided with . police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with 293 t of rubbish seized from the area around yeates  flat . crime stoppers offered a 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer , while   the sun   newspaper offered 50,000 . authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes , and warned women not           about the murder investigation yeates  father said , i fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in , but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible .  post-mortem and initial enquiries  following the discovery of yeates  body , detectives from the avon and somerset constabulary issued an appeal for anyone with information about the death to come forward , and investigated similarities with other unsolved cases . of particular interest to them were those of 20-year-old glenis carruthers who was strangled in 1974 , melanie hall , aged 25 , who disappeared in 1996 and whose body was discovered thirteen years later , and 35-year-old claudia lawrence who went missing in 2009 . investigators identified striking similarities between the yeates and hall cases , notably their age and appearance , and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends , but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities . the police gathered surveillance video from clifton suspension bridge , which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the clifton           was of poor quality , making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers . investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the river avon less than a mile to the south to avoid cctv coverage . a post-mortem examination began on 26 december 2010 , though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body . police initially thought it possible that yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury . investigators announced on 28 december 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the coroner determined that yeates had died as a result of strangulation . the post-mortem indicated that she had died .. several days before being discovered on 25 december 2010 . the examination also confirmed that yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased . detective chief inspector jones stated that the investigation found .. no evidence to suggest that joanna was sexually assaulted . the police searched reardon s laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure . reardon was ruled out as a suspect           a party at a neighbouring house on canynge road on the night of yeates  disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00 pm coming from the direction of yeates  flat . another neighbour who lived behind yeates  home said that he heard a high-pitched woman s voice scream help me . officers removed the front door to yeates  flat to check for clothing fibres and dna evidence , with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before yeates returned home .  further enquiries  senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the national policing improvement agency , which provides expertise for difficult cases . on 4 january 2011 , a clinical forensic psychologist , who had previously been involved as a criminal profiler in other high profile murder cases , joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects . jones stated that his officers had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry . jones said , i can assure you , we are determined to solve this crime and bring jo s killers to justice .           one of yeates  socks was missing when she was found dead and that it had not been found at the crime scene or in her home . police launched a national advertising campaign to appeal for witnesses through facebook . the page , established on 4 january , had been viewed nearly 250,000 times by the following day , while cctv footage of yeates had been viewed 120,000 times on youtube by 5 january . on 9 january 2011 , bristol east mp kerry mccarthy gave her support to the idea of a public dna screening process if the police found it useful . the avon and somerset constabulary had conducted mass dna screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of then-18-year-old louise smith . mccarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond clifton to the wider bristol area . dna that had been found on yeates  body was tested for a potential profile . detectives liaised with officials from the multi-agency public protection arrangements , which manages individuals convicted of violent and sexual offences , with a view to interviewing registered sex           of crime  shortly after 7.00 am on 30 december 2010 , christopher jefferies , yeates  landlord who lived in the same building , was arrested on suspicion of her murder . he was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat . on 31 december , a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest , enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning . police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 december and 1 january . investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours , but released jefferies on bail after two days . he retained the legal services of the law firm stokoe partnership to act on his behalf . on 4 march 2011 , police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect . he subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest , and received an apology from avon and somerset police for any distress caused to him during the           the case was filmed on location in bristol for broadcast in the 26 january edition of the bbc television programme   crimewatch   . a firm that had been involved in the production of the   harry potter   films was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions at the time of yeates  disappearance . the reconstruction of yeates  last movements was filmed on 18 january , and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production , over 300 people contacted the police . a breakthrough led investigators to believe that yeates  body may have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase . on the morning of 20 january , the avon and somerset constabulary arrested 32-year-old dutch engineer vincent tabak , who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to yeates . however , authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of jefferies  arrest , which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested . the tabak arrest followed an anonymous           appeal by yeates  parents on   crimewatch   . canynge road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around yeates  home ; and officers sealed off tabak s adjacent flat . investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend , where tabak was believed to have been staying , about a mile away . tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation , and had returned to england from a holiday visit to his family in the netherlands . following tabak s arrest , the bbc cancelled its plans to air the yeates re-enactment on   crimewatch   . on 31 january , previously unseen photos of yeates were released through the programme s website.  dna tests  dna tests were carried out by lgc forensics , a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations . lindsey lennen , a body fluids and dna specialist member of the team that analysed dna samples from yeates  body , said that although dna swabs matched tabak , they were not of sufficient quality           as dna sence , which enhances unusable dna samples through purification and concentration : we could nt say whether the dna was from saliva , or semen , or even touch . but we could say that the probability of it not being a match with tabak was less than one in a billion .  legal proceedings and perpetrator   murder charge and plea  after questioning during 96 hours of detention , tabak was charged on 22 january 2011 with the murder of joanna yeates . he made a brief appearance at bristol s magistrates  court on 24 january and was remanded in custody . tabak , legally represented by paul cook , declined to request bail during a hearing the following day . tabak was moved from bristol prison because of fears for his safety , and was placed under suicide watch at long lartin prison near evesham . tabak s family and friends in the netherlands started to fundraise for his court defence . tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for joanna yeates  death , claiming that dna evidence linking him to the           on 8 february , he told peter brotherton , a prison chaplain , that he had killed her and intended to plead guilty . on 5 may 2011 , vincent tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of yeates , but denied murdering her . his plea of guilty to manslaughter was rejected by the crown prosecution service . on 20 september , tabak appeared in person at a pre-trial hearing at bristol crown court . appearances at previous hearings had been made via videolink from prison .  vincent tabak  vincent tabak was a dutch engineer who had lived and worked in the united kingdom since 2007 . the son of gerald and sonja tabak , and the youngest of five siblings , he was raised in uden , 21 miles north of eindhoven . tabak s childhood next-door neighbour , john massoeurs , described him after the trial as an intelligent introverted loner . tabak studied at eindhoven university of technology beginning in 1996 , graduating with an msc in architecture , building and planning in 2003 , then           of how people use space in office buildings and public areas . the paper was published in 2008 . leaving university in 2007 , he moved to the united kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of buro happold , an engineering consultancy firm in bath , and settled in a flat in the town . he worked as a people flow analyst , a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools , airports and sports stadiums . while living in bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through   the guardian   s online dating website   soulmates   . she was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend ; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis : i am very happy she entered my life . the couple moved to a flat in canynge road , bristol , in june 2009 . though joanna yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in canynge road in the autumn of 2010 , she and tabak           months leading up to yeates  death , tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the united kingdom and united states , and contacted several prostitutes by phone . he also viewed violent internet pornography that depicted women being controlled by men , showing images of them being bound and gagged , held by the neck and choked . during the murder investigation , police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to yeates . in one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts . when yeates was discovered , she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top . at tabak s trial , prosecuting barrister nigel lickley qc , argued that the evidence of tabak s activities should be provided to the jury : it might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life . details of tabak s viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution s case since the judge believed it did not prove           it was disclosed that images of child pornography had been found on tabak s laptop . in december 2013 , the crown prosecution service announced that he would be prosecuted for possessing the material .  trial  the trial of vincent tabak started on 4 october 2011 at the crown court at bristol before mr justice field and a jury . his counsel in the trial was william clegg qc and the prosecutor was nigel lickley qc . tabak pleaded guilty to manslaughter , but denied murder . the prosecution case was that tabak had strangled yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 december 2010 , using sufficient force to kill her . the prosecutors stated that tabak around taller than yeates had used his height and build to overpower her , pinning her to the floor by the wrists , and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head , neck , torso and arms during the struggle . the injuries included cuts , bruises , and a fractured nose . lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy , and           , he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind tabak s initial attack on yeates . evidence was presented that tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body . the court heard that dna swabs taken from yeates  body had provided a match with tabak . samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried , while fibres suggested contact with tabak s coat and car . blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where yeates was discovered . the prosecution also said that tabak attempted to implicate christopher jefferies for the murder during the police investigation , and that in the days following yeates  death , he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the clifton area . in his defence , tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated , and told the court that he had killed yeates while trying to silence her           he claimed that yeates had made a flirty comment and invited him to drink with her . he said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her . he denied suggestions of a struggle , claiming to have held yeates by the neck with only minimal force , and .. for about 20 seconds . he told the court that after dumping the body he was .. in a state of panic . the jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 october , and returned with a verdict two days later . on 28 october 2011 , tabak was found guilty of joanna yeates  murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict . he was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 20 years . passing sentence , mr justice field referred to a sexual element to the killing .  media controversy  the manner in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the british media led to one television broadcaster being temporarily banned from attending press conferences , and the instigation of legal           , and the attorney general . following a television news report on 4 january 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation , itn reporters were banned by the avon and somerset constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case . the item , presented by journalist geraint vincent , claimed police had made little progress with their investigation , and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods . a former murder squad detective told the report that certain routine inquiries such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out . itn accused the police of attempting .. to censor what information we can broadcast .. while the constabulary filed a complaint with the office of communications , calling the broadcast .. unfair , nave and irresponsible reporting . the police subsequently lifted the sanctions against itn , but said that they would .. not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future . legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage . the contempt of           writing in london s   evening standard   on 5 january 2011 , media commentator roy greenslade expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning yeates  landlord , christopher jefferies , following his arrest , describing the coverage as .. character assassination on a large scale . he cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published , including a headline in   the sun   describing jefferies a former teacher at clifton college as weird , posh , lewd and creepy ; a story from the   daily express   quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as .. a sort of nutty professor who made them feel creeped out by his strange behaviour ; and an article from the   daily telegraph   , which reported jefferies .. has been described by pupils at clifton college .. as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films . jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 april   the sun   , the   daily mirror   ,            daily express   , the   daily mail   and the   daily record   seeking damages for libel . he was represented by louis charalambous of the law firm simons muirhead and burton , who in 2008 had successfully acted for robert murat after he became a suspect during the investigation into the disappearance of madeleine mccann and had faced similar media scrutiny . on 29 july jefferies accepted substantial damages for defamation from   the sun   , the   daily mirror   , the   sunday mirror   , the   daily record   , the   daily mail   , the   daily express   , the   daily star   and   the scotsman   in connection with their coverage of his arrest . in an interview following tabak s conviction , jefferies commented : it has taken up a whole year virtually of my life , that period of time has meant that everything else that i would normally be doing has been           change the law on legal aid , which he said would prevent people with limited means from taking action against newspapers . dominic grieve , the attorney general for england and wales , stated on 31 december 2010 that he was considering action under the contempt of court act 1981 to enforce the obligation of the media not to prejudice a possible future trial . criminology professor david wilson commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media : the british public loves a whodunnit .. it s a particularly british thing . we were the first nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere . wilson called yeates , a white female professional , an ideal victim for the media . on 1 january , yeates  boyfriend greg reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of christopher jefferies : jo s life was cut short tragically but the finger-pointing and character assassination by social and news media of as yet innocent men has been shameful . on 12 may 2011 , the administrative court           committal for contempt of court against   the sun   and the   daily mirror   for the way they had reported the arrest of jefferies . on 29 july , the court ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court , and fined the   daily mirror   50,000 and   the sun   18,000 . the lord chief justice of england and wales , lord judge , stated that .. in our judgment , as a matter of principle , the vilification of a suspect under arrest is a potential impediment to the course of justice . the publishers of   the sun   and the   daily mirror   subsequently appealed their fines , but the   mirror   case was rejected by the supreme court of england and wales on 9 march 2012 , whilst   the sun   withdrew its appeal .  ramifications  the yeates case was mentioned during a parliamentary debate on a private           on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect . the proposed legislation was introduced into the house of commons in june 2010 , by anna soubry , the conservative mp for broxtowe , a former journalist and criminal law barrister . in a debate on 4 february 2011 soubry told the house : what we saw in bristol was , in effect , a feeding frenzy and vilification . much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant , but there was a homophobic tone to it which i found deeply offensive . the slurs on the man were out of order . however , she withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the conservative-led coalition government . jefferies gave evidence to the leveson inquiry , established by prime minister david cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the british media following the   news of the world   phone hacking affair . jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had besieged him after he was questioned by the police ; he said : it was clear that the tabloid press had decided that i was guilty of miss           of my guilt . they embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue . appearing before the same inquiry on 16 january 2012 , the   daily mirror   editor , richard wallace , described the newspaper s coverage of jefferies  arrest as a black mark on his editing record .  aftermath and memorials  associate vicar dan clark led a memorial service for yeates at christ church in clifton on 2 january 2011 . prayers for her were also said at the church on 17 december 2011 , the first anniversary of her death , while visitors left tributes and messages of condolence for her family . greg reardon started a charity website in yeates  memory to raise funds on behalf of families of missing people . yeates  friends and family planted a memorial garden at the sir harold hillier gardens in romsey where she had worked as a student . building design partnership and the local nhs trust announced plans to commemorate her with a memorial in a           hospital in southmead , bristol . other plans for memorials included a garden of remembrance at the bdp firm s studio

type = drained freshwater loch location = kilmaurs and stewarton , east ayrshire , scotland depth = volume = islands = one crannog buiston loch , also known as buston , biston , and mid buiston was situated in the mid-ayrshire clayland at an altitude of 90 m od . it is visible as an often flooded surface depression in pastureland situated in a low lying area close to the a735 road between the farms and dwellings of lochside , buistonend and mid-buiston in the parishes of kilmaurs and stewarton , east ayrshire , scotland . the loch was natural , sitting in a hollow created by glaciation . the loch waters drained via the garrier burn that joins the bracken and lochridge burns before joining the river irvine . it is well documented through the presence of a crannog first excavated 1880-1 and then documented by mr. d. mcnaught , dr r. munro and others .  history  blaeu s map of 1654 , based on timothy pont s work of the late 16th century , shows           , however by the mid-eighteenth century the loch appears to have been drained . the garrier burn is marked on thomson s map of 1828 , however it has been canalised and field drains added by the time of the first ordnance survey of the mid 19th century , presumably as part of an improved drainage system . around 1830 the loch was described by a mr hay as being a mossy bog in the summer and a sheet of water throughout the winter and by 1880 a   richly cultivated meadow   . buiston was a post-glacial loch , on the lands of the farm known as mid-buiston , for many years the property of the earls of eglinton , and was at first believed to be a structure built by the earls of eglinton to house a shelter for shooting waterfowl . evidence of the original shoreline persists on the northern side of the loch basin . the early ordnance survey maps and written descriptions show the site as fully drained and under cultivation , however drainage is now inadequate and the area is           the loch s drainage may have begun in the early 18th century when alexander montgomerie , 10th earl of eglinton , was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates . further drainage work may have taken place in the 1740s as part of the improvements undertaken to provide employment for montgomerie irish estate workers during the irish potato famines of the 1740s and the mid 19th centuries . many drainage schemes also date to the end of wwi when many soldiers returned en masse to civilian life .  the crannog  the roughly circular crannog , known as the  swan knowe  , lay around 70 m from the northern shore and was identified in december 1880 from  worked  timbers located within the drainage  gote  or ditch on the site by a teacher from kilmaurs , duncan mcnaught , who was familiar with the lochlea crannog site . the site was first excavated in 1880 and more thoroughly in april 1881 . in 1989-90 the site was re-excavated as part of an investigation into the condition of crannogs in south-west scotland commissioned           decay on crannog sites . finds included a rare fourth century hanging bowl , a dugout canoe , and two ovens . the crannog had four periods of occupation , dating from ad1 to ad 525 , that is from before the roman conquest of this area , through the period of the damnonian tribe s rule , and into the time of the brythonic kingdom of strathclyde . three log boats or canoes seem to have been found , the one in 1989-90 was left on site , another was lost in a fire at the dick institute in 1909 and the third may survive in the hunterian museum in the form of an unprovenanced specimen from the 1881 dig . file:loch tay crannog.jpga reconstruction of a crannog in loch tay file:buiston loch canoe 1881. jpga buiston loch canoe file:buiston crannog plan.jpgplan of buiston loch file:buiston crannog excavations 1881. jpgview of the crannog excavations much timber had been taken away prior to the crannog s identification and a local farmer is recorded as having remarked   there maun hae been dwallers here at           layers of turves , stones , intermingled within branches and tree trunks . no gangway was found leading to the crannog , which may have had a single large circular dwelling located on it .

tivoli provisioning manager is a product in ibms tivoli software brand . its purpose is to automate the provisioning of virtual servers and software . tpm is a manager of managers , in that it does not manage any hardware itself , but issues commands to the hypervisors that do actually manage the hardware . tpm can orchestrate the various tasks , and provide a common interface for different platforms , notably intel-based managed by vmware to host ms-windows and linux virtual servers ; and ibm s own aix servers running on pseries.  history  tpm originated with think dynamics which ibm acquired in 2003 . their think control product was good in provisioning and managing servers in data centers . ibm added their opal integrated service management library , and marketed their new product as tivoli information orchestrator - hence the appearance of the letters tio in many product files of tpm . while tio appears to not have been a huge success , ibm spun off the deployment engine as a product of itself . * v4 : combined           as tpm for software * v5 : general provisioning resources * there appears not to have been a v6 * v7.1 : integrated with the new tivoli process automation engine gui . tpm was also incorporated into tivoli service automation manager . * v7.2 : has many improvements ; most notably , the workflows are no longer extracted from the dcm database and executed line by line , but are converted to java and run from bytecode , which is much faster .  working   data center model  tpm works from an extensive data center model that contains all server- and software-components , with their attributes and relations . as of v7.1 , this is part of the maximo database .  workflows  all tpm s actions are executed by workflows . these are written in a proprietary interpreted procedural scripting language . most information must be drawn through queries from the dcm . most string manipulation must be done by jython calls - because both the workflow interpreter and jython parse , interpret , and manipulate these strings , great           server systems are done through scriptlets , which generate scripts that are executed on the target servers .  developing  for developing tpm workflows , one needs the so-called automation package development environment : this is the eclipse integrated development environment with a special tpm plugin . it needs to be configured to have access to the dcm database : all workflow code is stored by line in the database .

related = audi 80/4000 audi quattro the audi coup is a two-door coup produced and sold by audi from 1980 to 1988 . the car was an attempt by audi to offer a cheaper version of its turbocharged , permanent four-wheel drive audi quattro - without turbochargers or four wheel drive . later , quattro was added as an option .   typ   81 was the internal model code for front-wheel drive audi coups .  history  the coup , first displayed at the paris salon 1980 , featured a similar body shape to the quattro , but without the knife-edged fender flares of the more expensive car . mechanically , the biggest changes from the quattro to the coup were the use of a naturally aspirated 1.9 litre carburettor petrol engine , 2.0 litre , 2.1 , 2.2 , or 2.3 litre fuel injected inline five cylinder engine and a front-wheel drive drivetrain . some lesser coups were also fitted with a 1.8 litre inline           the very first year of production a 1.6-litre yn 75pskw 0 engine was available . the short-lived 1.6 was the only coup not to be fitted with a black rear spoiler . the coup was available as just plain coup or gl , coup gt , and coup quattro . from 1986 until the end of production in late 1988 , the coup gt was also available with the 110-112pskw 0 1.8-litre   pv/dz   inline-four best known from the golf gti . for the last model year , the new 2,309 cc ng five cylinder was available , offering 136pskw 0 at 5,600 rpm . this engine became available during 1987 for the last of the audi coups sold in the us , where it produced 130hpkw 0 at 5,700 rpm as opposed to the 110hpkw 0 at 5,500 rpm available from the 2.2-litre five which had been used since the facelift for model year 1985 . the coup had originally gone on sale in the us late in model year 1981 with the 100hpkw 0 2,144 cc           .  facelift  the updated coup , introduced after the german industrial holidays in the autumn of 1984 , was given new , slightly sloped radiator grille and headlights , a large wrap-around bumper with integrated spotlights and turn signals , plastic sill covers , and the large rear spoiler from the audi quattro . these changes brought the drag coefficient down to 0.36 . a new dashboard was also introduced , as was a new interior . gl and standard versions were cancelled for model year 1987 and all fwd coups were from then referred to as coup gt . for the 1986 model year , the coups were available with more catalyzed engine options . also , the entire b2 range received stainless steel exhausts .  coup quattro  also in september 1984 , audi made available the option of the quattro permanent four-wheel drive system to produce the audi coup quattro , a model which was rarer than the turbocharged quattro model . while most common with the 2.2           introduced 1987 for the us ) , in some markets the 1.8 litre four-cylinder models were also available with four-wheel drive . the coup and coup quattro models appear almost identical from the outside except for a few minor quattro specifics . while the gt had coupe gt on the rear side windows , the cq had the quattro decal as used on the ur-quattro . similarly at the rear , the badging was gt and quattro respectively . the quattro versions also used the ur-quattro rear windscreen with quattro written into the heater elements , and the front grille was also adorned with the quattro badge from the ur-q . inside , the cabin was identical except that the centre console received a differential lock switch , and led bargraph displays in place of the gt s three analogue-style gauges . some coup quattros were distinguished by a body-coloured rear spoiler . mechanically , the coup quattro depended on a combination           . the quattro permanent four-wheel drive drivetrain was almost identical to that used on the ur-quattro - the main differences being the use of the coup gt front struts , smaller 256mm 0 diameter front brake disks , and lower ratios in the gearbox and rear differential . the damper and spring rates were also different from the ur-q . it was thus largely identical to the audi 90 quattro and the north american audi 4000 quattro . roadwheels were 6.0jx14 , with steel or aluminium alloy rims dependent on the market . 7.0jx15 ronals , almost identical to the ur-quattro wheels , were also available . the cq/90q/4000q also received their own exhaust manifold and downpipe . from september 1980 to september 1987 , 174,687   typ   81 coups were built . quattro production ran from late 1984 to 1988 , and was in the total region of 8,000 cars .
stat-ease , inc. is a privately held company producing statistical software in minneapolis , minnesota founded by pat whitcomb in 1982 . the company currently has 14 employees . the company provides software packages for engineers and scientists using design of experiments methods for optimizing development of products and processes . it also provides doe training and consulting services .  history  stat-ease was founded by pat whitcomb while at general mills in 1982 . he later brought in two of his general mills colleaguestryg helseth as programmer and mark anderson as business manager . whitcomb and anderson are principals of the company today . the company sold its first software in june 1985 . sales took off in 1987 when the software was described as incredibly easy to use in a review of doe software . in 1988 , the company released its first version of design-expert software , which provided the tools for response surface methods for process optimization . this package complemented design-ease , which handled factorial designs , and also provided statistical tools for optimizing mixtures in           added the features of design-ease into design-expert version 5 and translated it from dos to windows . both packages are still marketed today . in 1996 ,   forbes   magazine said the new mantra for process improvement is multivariate testing and added : a minneapolis software firm , stat-ease , sells most of the software these mvt types use . felix grant , reviewing design-expert version 7.1.3 in   scientific computing magazine   said : in a mature , well-established product which dominates its market , upgrades should be expected to reflect developing practice and display evolutionary growth rather than piling on attention-seeking gimmicks ; and so it is here ... core functions have been extended usefully .. the design editor in design-expert has long been a strong point , providing a central cockpit from which to intuitively refine and test most aspects , but various new control features have now been added to the package , small in themselves but significantly enhancing productive control.  statistical design of experiments  minimum-run resolution iv and minimum-run resolution v experimental designs           . minimum-run resolution iv factorial designs estimate all main effects , clear of two-factor or higher interactions , in a minimum of experimental runs . mr4 designs work well for factor screening . minimum-run resolution v factorial designs estimate all main effects and two-factor interactions in a minimum of experimental runs . mr5 designs are typically done after screening to a vital few factors , which then need to be studied in more depth in case they interact . whitcomb and oehlert won the shewell award in 2008 for invention of the half-normal plot of effects for general factorials . they also developed statistical tools in 2008 to calculate power for a broad range of experimental designs and precision as a power substitute via fraction of design space for response surface methods and mixture design . whitcomb and anderson have written two non-academic books on doe ; the books include a free educational version of stat-ease software .  applications  alberto-culver developed a new line of scrubs using design-expert software from stat-ease . stat-ease was used by los           designed to demonstrate the application of model validation techniques to a structural dynamics problem . stat-ease was used by researchers to design experiments to optimize the effects of storage on the physico-chemical , microbiological and sensory quality on bottlegourd-basil leaf juice . invitrogen used stat-ease design-expert software to optimize a cell culture bioproduction system . the researcher states : this experiment demonstrates how a robotically controlled microbioreactor system can be combined with doe methods to optimize cell-culture media and feeding strategies . the new process is rich in information and provides a solid understanding of the most influential factors affecting performance of specific cell lines . the united states environmental protection agency evaluated the physicochemical properties of nine surfactants used in the remediation of perchloroethylene in aqueous solutions using a response surface quadratic design model of experiment . design-expert software was used to generate the experimental design and perform the analysis . the research provided predictive models for alterations in the physiochemical properties of pore fluid to surfactant enhanced acquifer remediation of pce . researchers investigated the possibility of producing poly-3-hydroxybutyrate polyester using           optimized using doe performed with design-expert software . researchers at the university of nottingham demonstrated that the dna extracted from both green and roasted beans could be used in a restriction fragment length polymorphism based analysis to dierentiate between arabica and robusta types of coee . design-expert software was used for design of experiments comparing and optimizing yields using a variety of commercial dna extraction kits .

json-wsp is a web-service protocol that uses json for service description , requests and responses . it is very much inspired from json-rpc , but the lack of a service description specification with documentation in json-rpc sparked the design of json-wsp . the description format has the same purpose for json-wsp as wsdl has for soap or idl for corba , which is to describe the types and methods used in a given service . it also describes inter-type relations and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values . finally the description opens the possibility to add documentation on service , method , parameter and return levels . communication between clients and a json-wsp server is carried out using http post requests and responses , with the json objects as data with the content-type application/json.  specifications  json-wsp consists of four json object specifications : note           notation    building blocks   * if the name of the building-block being defined starts with rx- , it means that the definition is a regular expression . in these definitions square brackets have the role of defining character classes and parentheses have the role of defining capturing groups . * in all other cases , square brackets notate lists and parentheses notate either a decision : : a repetition of 0-many : * a repetition 1-many : + or something optional : ?

  erica turgida   is a species of erica that was naturally restricted to the city of cape town , south africa , but is now classified as extinct in the wild . this small , delicate erica produces thin , willowy stems , covered in velvety hair . it produces masses of bright-pink , cup-shaped flowers . this erica used to grow naturally in the area that is now beneath the cape town suburbs of rondebosch , kenilworth and wynberg . it was therefore an endemic to the critically endangered cape flats sand fynbos vegetation type . soon before the last wild population died out at kenilworth racecourse conservation area , a woman named elsie esterhuizen took cuttings to kirstenbosch gardens and thus saved the species from permanent extinction . along with its fellow extinct-in-the-wild heath ,   erica verticillata   , it is now being re-introduced to the kenilworth racecourse conservation area , now that the spread of the invasive alien vegetation there has been controlled .

george faulkner was the supposed originator of the foundation of owens college , manchester . faulkner was born about 1790 in oldham street , manchester , in which town his life was spent . in 1812 he entered into partnership in a well-established firm of silk , cotton , and linen manufacturers , which still , though no longer under his name , continues to prosper . for a time its business included a fine-spinning mill , in which faulkner s intimate friend , john owens , was one of his partners . at some date before owens s death , which happened in 1846 he is said to have informed faulkner that he had made his will , in which he had left all his property to his friend . faulkner , the story continues , refused point-blank to accept another fortune in addition to his own . owens s irritation at this singular conduct , however , ceased after a few days , when faulkner suggested to him the plan of leaving the bulk of his wealth for the           unconditioned by religious tests . according to a paper ascribed to the late professor henry rogers faulkner was himself indebted for the original suggestion of his generous conception to samuel fletcher , a public-spirited and philanthropic manchester merchant , who , unlike faulkner , was a nonconformist . in any case the advice was taken , and when in 1851 owens college was actually called into life at manchester , faulkner was elected the first chairman of its trustees . he filled this post efficiently till august 1858 , taking repeated opportunities of supplementing his friend s munificence by liberal benefactions of his own . he died 21 february 1862 , leaving behind him a justly honoured name .

swedish dance recording artist           life stories over the past few years .   the night the sun came up   is mainly an electropop and dance-pop album , which incorporates elements of several musical genres such as dubstep and urban . the themes of the album range from sex , partying , introspection , love and life . in the united states , the album reached a peak of number sixty-one ,

television channel mtvu and the   billboard   hot dance airplay chart . in 2009 , dev moved to los angeles to produce music with the cataracs and work directly with indie-pop . during that time , songs like fireball and booty bounce were made . the latter track was produced in the same summer as the the cataracs produced like a g6 , at the time where dev and the cataracs were grinding it out in the studio pretty tough together , making a couple of simplistic random tracks . like a g6 , which features the cataracs and dev , was released in april 2010 , and reached           hot 100 chart in october of that year , prompting universal republic to sign her on as an artist in the same month .  recording and development  the album s production process began in january 2011 in costa rica . the cataracs , who helmed the entire album s production , worked with dev on the songwriting for the album , helping her with the themes to help diversify the content . she said that they were perfect producers for her , noting that they made really fun songs for kids on the radio and at the same time they were normal boys , eating burritos , chilling in berkeley , which is what she felt connected her with them . she hinted early on in the interview that she had an interest in working with other people for the album , noting that other producers and writers have contacted her . she later came back stating i think me and the cataracs are on a really good streak right now and it s not intentional . dev moved in with the cataracs to produce the album . she           in a movie . she also claimed the experience gave the album an amazing vibe . on interview with alex kazemi of   fashionindie   , dev stated that their sessions are very different and complicated , further commenting it really depends , some times the boys will come to me and say ive been wanting to do this song but this is more of a dev track and from there niles will show me the beat and me and david will come up with lyrics or some times i go to them when i have written some sort of idea and they will help me elaborate on it to the point where we can have a song . during the time they were in costa rica , they recorded thirteen to fourteen songs for the album . the song , take her from you , was composed while in costa rica recording the album . the song was originally written by one of the cataracs for himself and while reading some of the lyrics , dev expressed her interest in recording the song .  concept and themes           to escape the comparisons to other artists in the electropop genre , including american recording artist kesha and singer-songwriter uffie . she noted that the comparisons helped motivate her to take the music to a new level and sing on the majority of the album . she further explains that the material on the album has more diversity , bringing together different sounds and conveying more depth in the songwriting . she described that the songs are influenced by hip hop and electro music . the album , according to dev , will bring together my dev intricate influences and the cataracs simple influences . while on interview with kiss 92.5 , she commented that the music on the set will contain music stylized toward club and dance music and hip-hop influenced tracks where she will rap the entire song .  composition    the night the sun came up   is primary an

        elements of music to make an eclectic set . she also said that the album has two sides to it , sassy and pretty . the sassy songs are based on the themes of sex , partying and different forms of debauchery while the pretty songs are contemplative ballads that are based more on introspection and love . much of the album s lyrics are influenced by her life and her experiences . the album opens with getaway , a hip hop track with influences of soul music . the song starts out with the use of a piano , transitions into hip-hop styled music and features a breakdown in which she raps and rhymes . the next song in my trunk runs through an electronic tinged hip hop beat and features vehicle metaphors in its lyrics . the third track of the album , me , contains influences of adult contemporary music . the fourth song breathe is an electronic dance song that contains influences of middle eastern and club music . it is written about sex and the effects of love on dev and features the use of an           her from you , differs completely from the electronic soundscape of the album , as it is inspired by rock and roll music . when dev heard the song , she responded  oh , i really like that . it could almost be a flip of me singing about myself .  .. we considered maybe we should change around the perspective , but i was like ,  no . let s keep it like that .  the sixth track , lightspeed , is an electronic pop song that in its production draws inspiration from house and club music . it makes use of kickdrums , synth arrangements , auto-tune and numerous noises like a cough . its synth riff and beat structure resembles those in the music made by dutch disc jockey afrojack . the seventh track , dancing shoes is built upon synthesizers and drums while making use of pianos and guitars to produce an uptempo electronic rock ballad about performing onstage . the song s pretty sound is inspired by teen pop music after dancing shoes is the eighth track , perfect match , a           that featured in clocks by british alternative rock group coldplay . in bass down low , the ninth song and first single , dev speaks of taking shots and various forms of debauchery . it is an electro song with skittering synths and a pulsating electropop groove in which dev utilizes her sing-talk vocal style throughout the song , but also uses her singing voice near the end .   the night the sun came up s tenth track kiss my lips , the third single from the album in the united states , contains a guitar that blends synthesizers prominent in dance music with a hip hop styled drum beat . in the song , she sings to a lover get you hand off my hip/and kiss my lips , kiss my lips , kiss me all over/ are you gon na take that risk , take that risk ,  cause only getting older . in the dark has a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff that serves as the song s instrumentation . while featuring eurodance beats and synths , mixed with influences of latin music           draws from influences of folk music  reception   critical reception  the album received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics with an aggregated score metascore of 71 of 100 in metacritic based on 4 reviews . chuck eddy from rolling stone gave to the album 3.5 out of 5 stars , writing that the album is as stark as it is sweet , owed partly to the casually giddy lightness of her talk-singing . ben norman from about.com gave to the album three stars out of five , summarizing that dev s debut album is at least little more than pandering to the mainstream . there are some interesting tracks that give us flashes of insight into the minds creating the works . whether the credit goes to dev or to her producers is uncertain but almost irrelevant , as long as you enjoy it . that being said , the night the sun came up is well-crafted , quality dance/pop . if dev achieves another hit from it , i ll be shocked . jamie horne of   the border mail   gave the album           , noting the ranges of music influences , including dance , rock and folk , and noted that it was not boring . chanun poomsawai of bangkok post reviewed the album positively , praising its diversity and mixture of fierce and mellow and further commented that this is a solid electro-edged pop album best played while you re getting dressed up before heading out for a night on the town . elysa gardner from usa today wrote that on the album her fresh , lissome vocals are actually more intriguing than the textural , tonal and rhythmic shifts that pop up in the sometimes sweetly groovy but mostly unremarkable tunes . music rating website   musicovered   gave the album three out of ten stars , stating the album comes short of expectations and that the production was sloppy , with many of the album s tracks sounding the same . sal cinquemani shares the same feeling on his review of the album for   slant magazine   , rating the album two and a half stars out of five . he adds that the album fails           rapping style , comparing it to that of swedish recording artist robyn , and the song in the dark for blending european dance music with flourishes of latin and mediterranean music . neil miller , jr . of ur chicago rated the album two out of five stars , calling it one of the most unbalanced pop records ever released . idolator however claims that to peg dev as a kesha clone is dangerous as she has a greater air of mystery than kesha and the positive review ends with for those out there who like the soundtrack to their late-night fiesta to come with a bit more subtlety .

label = varse sarabande   how to train your dragon : music from the motion picture   was composed by john powell for the film of the same name and released by varse sarabande on march 23 , 2010 . the score earned powell his first academy award nomination and his third bafta nomination , which he lost to   the social network   and   the king s speech   , respectively . the score also won the international film music critics association 2011 awards for best original score for an animated feature and film score of the year , and was nominated twice for film music composition of the year for the tracks forbidden friendship and test drive .  background    how to train your dragon   was composer john powell s sixth collaboration with dreamworks animation . powell had scored many of dreamworks  previous films , but this was the first of dreamworks  films where powell helmed the score on his own . zimmer had long praised powell s abilities , and on many occasions , asserted that he was the superior composer between them , thus firmly supporting powell s first solo animation effort . for the score , powell utilized many celtic influences , employing instruments like the fiddle , bagpipes , dulcimer , pennywhistle , and even a harpsichord . icelandic singer jnsi was brought on to write and record the song sticks &amp; stones , which plays during the end credits of the film . in an interview with   the wrap s steve pond , powell talked about his intent for the score : i was certainly trying to get a bit more epic . i just felt the animation and the visuals were giving me a broader palette to play with . as a kid i remember watching   the vikings   with tony curtis and kirk douglas , and i always liked that score . the directors were really very specific a lot of the time . they did want size and depth and emotion . they wanted a feeling of the           past was nielson , the danish symphonist . sibelius . grieg to a certain extent , although i think he was a little bit more germanic than he was nordic . sibelius was the key . i studied a lot of sibelius as a kid , and i ve always adored his music . so that , plus it was great to have jnsi do a song at the end of the movie , because i ve always liked moody icelandic band sigur rs . they were an influence as well , even though that seems paradoxical . but there is that in a few cuesheavy , dark guitar textures going on at the same time as large orchestration . we looked at all the folk music from the nordic areas . and i m part scottish and grew up with a lot of scottish folk music , so that came into it a lot . and celtic music was something that jeffrey katzenberg  critical reception  rev2 = rev4 = rev5 = rev7 = rev8 = rev9 = the score was exceptionally well-received , earning universal praise from professional           bafta nomination for his work as well as his first oscar nomination , losing both nominations to alexandre desplat for his score for   the king s speech   , and to trent reznor and atticus ross for their score for   the social network   , respectively . the music also won an annie award for the best music in a feature production from the international animated film association , asifa-hollywood . christian clemmensen , founder of   filmtracks.com   and member of the ifmca , praised the score , saying that powell has finally managed to create a well rounded and more easily digestible variation on his typical mannerisms for   how to train your dragon   . he however criticized the use of scottish and irish tones in a score meant for vikings , as well as the jnsi song sticks &amp; stones , which he felt drained all the enthusiasm out of the environment created by powell . however , clemmensen still awarded the score the highest rating of five stars , and later listed the score as one           expressed similar opinions about the score . jonathan broxton , founder of and another member of the ifmca said : its very rare that one can listen to an entire 70+ minute album and honestly say that all of them have musical merit , but that is genuinely the case here . usually scores of this length have a fair amount of filler , but on   how to train your dragon   every cue has worth . archie watt from   moviecues   said : i sincerely hope that powells work will be rewarded with an oscar in 2011 . it couldnt be more deservedthe score is by far the best of the year to date , and i cant foresee any other score taking that accolade from this masterpiece . both reviewers named it as the best score of the year .  awards and nominations   track listing   references

the porticus catuli was a landmark on the palatine hill in ancient rome . it was built by quintus lutatius catulus to commemorate his joint victory with gaius marius over the cimbri at vercellae . the portico was adjacent to the house     of catulus , which pliny the elder regarded as one of the grandest built in the late 2nd century bc . the practice of expanding a family s   domus   from the relatively modest structures of the mid-republic began at this time . the porticus catuli became known for the display of art works there . its impressiveness rivaled that of the temple of honor and virtue built by marius also to commemorate the victory , for which both men earned a triumph . the porticus catuli was located on a prominent piece of real estate that had already been highly politicized . it had formerly been the site of the house of m. fulvius flaccus , one           condemned to death and had their property confiscated and destroyed . in the mid-1st century bc , the porticus catuli was involved in the feud between cicero and clodius . when cicero was condemned to exile for putting roman citizens to death without allowing them right of appeal , clodius razed cicero s house and perhaps also the porticus catuli to build a shrine     to libertas . if the portico was razed rather than incorporated into the new religious complex , it was rebuilt along with cicero s house when the orator was restored to rome .
birthplace = vitebsk , belarus lev samuilovich klejn , better known as leo klejn , is a russian archaeologist , anthropologist and philologist.  early life  klejn was born on 1 july 1927 in vitebsk , belarus , to two jewish physicians , polish-born stanislav semenovich and asya moysseevna . both of klejn s grandparents were wealthy : one a factory owner , the other a highly ranked merchant . stanislav semenovich served as a medical officer in the anti-bolshevik volunteer army during the russian civil war . by the end of the war he had joined the red army , but was never a member of the communist party . in 1941 both of klejn s parents were drafted to serve in the great patriotic war , while the rest of the family were evacuated , first to volokolamsk and then egoryevsk near moscow , and then to yoshkar-ola in the mari assr . there klejn worked on a collective farm before leaving school at the age of 16 and being attached to the 3rd belorussian front           in grodno and klejn studied for a year at a railway technical school . while still in high school klejn created an underground liberal organisation called  prometheus  . this drew the attention of the kgb , but owing to the age of those involved there were no serious consequences .  career  upon graduating high school klejn entered the grodno pedagogical institute in the faculty of language and history . in 1947 , after a year there , he spoke against the first secretary of grodno s party committee at a conference and was forced to leave . he transferred to leningrad state university , first as a corresponding student , and then full-time . at leningrad he studied both archaeology under mikhail artamonov and russian philology under vladimir propp . while there he continued to act contrary to party dogma by reading a paper criticising the work of nicholas marr . klejn escaped expulsion for this , however , as shortly thereafter marr s theories were denounced by stalin himself . graduating with honours from the faculty of history in 1951 , klejn worked as a librarian           leningrad for postgraduate studies in archaeology . he began working in the department of archaeology in 1960 and became an assistant professor there in 1962 . this was unusual as klejn was a jew and not a member of the party , but he was appointed to the position by a special session of the faculty s party bureau on the strength of his academic qualifications . he was awarded a candidate of sciences degree in 1968 , defending a thesis on the origins of the donets catacomb culture . in 1976 he was made docent . klejn s first printed work was published in 1955 ; his first monograph in 1978 . he participated in a series of archaeological fieldwork expeditions in russia , belarus and ukraine , the last 5 seasons as head of the expedition . these included excavations of early rus  towns and bronze age and scytho-sarmatian barrows.  persecution  klejn continued to chafe against the party-backed academic establishment as a teacher . in the 1960s , he organised a series of seminars on the           where he contradicted the anti-normanist position . then in the seventies he began working on theoretical problems in history and archaeologya subject that had been completely neglected since stalin s purges of academia in the 1930sand found himself contradicting the orthodox marxist theory of historical materialism . his frequent publication in foreign journals also caused alarm . in the early 1970s klejn s brother boris , then teaching in a grodno institute , was dismissed and stripped of his degree and title for speaking against the introduction of soviet troops into czechoslovakia . his friendship with the disgraced belarusian writer vasil bykov also played a part in this . then in 1981 klejn himself was arrested for homosexuality on the orders of the kgb . during a search pornography was planted on him , but too crudely , and the court could not accept the evidence . nevertheless , klejn was convicted and imprisoned . the scholarly community , however , interpreted this as an attempt to get rid of a troublemaker rather than a genuine accusation and came to his defence . klejn neither affirmed nor denied the charge ,           an individual s sexual orientation is not the concern of society or the state . but in his account he relates a parallel investigation conducted by his fellow inmates which concluded he was not a homosexual . eventually the initial sentence was overturned by a higher court and commuted to eighteen months detention , which by this time klejn had almost served . after his release klejn , like his brother , was stripped of his degree and title . he recorded his prison experiences under the pen name lev samoylov in the journal   neva   and in his own name in the book   the world turned upside down    later career  klejn remained without an academic position for ten years following his release . following   perestroika   he began publishing again and , in 1994 , defended a new thesis and was awarded a doctor of sciences degree by unanimous vote . he co-founded the european university at st. petersburg and taught there until his retirement in 1997 at the age of 70           a number of institutions , including the universities of west berlin , vienna , durham , copenhagen , lubljana , turku , tromse , washington in seattle and the higher anthropological school of moldova . in 2001 he stopped teaching following treatment for cancer ; but continues to research and publish . he is currently a columnist in the   troitsky variant   .  work  a whole series of klejns books and articles on this subject are terminated by his metaarchaeology of 2001 .  theoretical archaeology  klejn has been a one of the world s leading writers on theoretical archaeology , a term he coined , since the 1970s . according to klejn , archaeological theories are programs of information processing based on a particular explanatory idea . additionally , theories become methodology by stipulating a set of standard techniques . klejn s elaboration of a special theory for archaeology went against the soviet view that historical materialism was the only theoretical basis of the humanities . it also was in conflict with the traditional           embracing all other humanistic and social scientific disciplines studying the past . according to klejn , archaeology is not a sub-field of history nor history armed with a spade , as an influential school of russian archaeology maintained , but a source-studying discipline similar to forensic science in its methodology . it processes archaeological sources , and translates them into the language of history , and finally transfers them to the historian for their incorporation into a historical synthesis . archaeology s typical questions are what , when , where , whence and how , whereas the historian s question is why or from what cause . klejn places particular emphasis upon rigorous methods of interpretation , in order to guard against the manipulation of antiquities in the service of political aims . his  echeloned archaeology  outlined three research procedures : empirical , deductive and problem-setting , each with a clear succession of stages of investigation , adjusted to different aims of research . his work on classification and typology in archaeology attempted to outline a strategy for producing classifications that are both useful and objectively valid . this           russian archaeology , stressed that some initial knowledge about the material to be classified as a whole is necessary to construct a reliable system of classification , and therefore that the process must work  backwards  from cultures to attributes . from a study of the principles underlying the interpretation of archaeological material klejn came to a dialectical inference that they are grouped in two rows , with every principle in each row directly facing its opposite in the other row . both rows are active in archaeology , and both are valid . one either has to choose one of them or to find balance between two . this discovery has implications for the project of working out the artificial intelligence of an archaeologist . this position is detailed in the principles of archaeology . klejns interest in ethnogenesis forced him to deal with the problem of how to synthesise different kinds of sources and with the place of archaeological sources in this synthesis . in klejns opinion ethnos is a category of in social psychology . this implies           idea of ethnos , and any real attributes are attached in various combinations to this notion . practically the problems of ethnogenesis are reduced to discovering the origins and history of language communities . so the question of peoples origins is first of all a linguistic problem . however there is no inevitable coincidence of language with archaeological culture , and even less is there a coincidence of the lines of succession of language and culture . usually archaeological culture has many roots and there is no inevitability that the language will be transmitted together with the most intensive cultural contribution . this is why lingual continuity does not correspond with cultural . cultural genesis is not ethnogenesis . in tracing lines of lingual continuity from a synthesis of different sources the lingual sources must be given priority . archaeological sources can only check and support in these investigations . klejn criticised the idea of omnipresent local origins , an idea that was inherited from marrs teaching and was established by ideological considerations , with a distinction between column and track sequentions . archaeological material is given us in column sequentions and has to be transferred to track sequentions. historiography . having exposed and evaluated various trends and having checked the general theories of archaeology with regard to their realisation , for klejn the history of archaeological discipline naturally became a branch of theoretical archaeology . he had much to do with this branch . his a panorama of theoretical archaeology caused a discussion in the world literature . bruce trigger greeted the emergence of such work from the soviet side with the words : no longer from another planet . klejn was the first who acquainted russian archaeology with new trends in the world archaeology . his book the new archaeology was published thirty year after it was written but was previously read in manuscript           appeared as the first history of world archaeology in russia no such book had previously existed in russia . the two-volume history of russian archaeology personified provides for the first time a new approach to the history of a discipline : presenting , separately , the history of events , the history of ideas and the history of persons . his book the phenomenon of soviet archaeology gives the first full and frank analysis of soviet archaeology and covers the period up to just after the end of the soviet era . the book has been translated into spanish , german and english .  klejns particular archaeological studies  in regard to particular archaeological studies , klejn has mainly studied the catacomb culture of the bronze age in the ukraine and on the volga-don steppes . he excavated barrows on the steppes of the ukraine and in southern russia , and the subject of his candidate dissertation was catacomb burials . at first he completely denied the           jutland via the danube plain . later he argued that this is not a single culture but several cultures . finally , on the basis of comparison with cultures of india and the rig-veda , he came to the inference that these were ancestors of indo-aryans . he therefore conceded that the local population of the pit-grave culture played a role in the formation of catacomb cultures : the pit-grave culture had long ago been connected to that of the aryans . such an early separation of indo-aryans from iranians leads to a revision of the time when the split of indo-european community occurred this must also have happened earlier than had previously been thought . ethnogenesis . from the very beginning klejn had a keen interest in problems of ethnogenesis his first printed work was devoted to the origin of slavs . later klejn delved deeply into problems of the origins of indo-europeans , especially their south-eastern branch aryans , greeks , armenians , phrygians           in the past greco-aryans including ancestors of aruans , greeks , arnebians and phrygians . his books ancient migrations and the time of centaurs : the steppe urheimat of the aryans and greeks were devoted to these problems . the norman problem . it is said that as an historian and archaeologist l. s. klejn contributed to resurrection of the so-called normanist theory , assigning to the vikings a significant role in the establishment of the ancient russian state and seeing the ryurikovichs as having scandinavian origins . yet this is an over-simplification . klejn played a part in the controversy of anti-normanism versus alleged normanism , and was even the main disputant in the third public dispute on this question . in the first miller argued fiercely against lomonosov , in the second pogodin against kostomarov , in the third klejn against shaskolsky . in the soviet time the acceptance of the participation of normans in the building of russian state was held to be antipatriotic , dangerous and           scope of normanism in order that this concept this accusation - could not be put on him . over the years klejn began to advance more frankly . in his opinion , there is in fact no norman theory : normanism does not exist and never did as an academic doctrine . by contrast , anti-normanism does exist - but only as an ideological platform , based on a russian inferiority complex . it is very characteristic that , although normans captured large parts of britain and france and conducted raids into germany , spain and byzantium , anti-normanism exists only in russia . neither the french nor british deny these facts . the struggle of anti-normanism against normanism is not a criticism of some theory but simply an argument about the facts . there are now many eminent russian scholars who take the same position . klejns contribution is that in his work the varangian controversy he exposes in detail the arguments of           . it is significant that he has structured the discussion by placing the arguments on the steps of a ladder leading to the most odious positions . so now the chaotic multiplicity of facts and ideas relating to the subject has received a structure and an order . it has become easier to evaluate the meaning of every reason when one has in mind its place in the whole discussion . klejn is also responsible for certain other original archaeological studies and hypotheses : the identification of the so-called zoomorphic sceptres of eneolithic ; the study of dice in steppe barrows ; the detailed study of karbuna hoard of early tripolyean culture ; the identification of pre-hittites with baden culture ; the reconstruction of phrygian migration to india a thousand years before alexander the great ; etc ..  philological works  klejns homeric studies are remarkable in russian philology the books anatomy of iliad , incorporeal heroes and other works . klejns studies of homer in the 80s issued from his study of the           a course of lectures on the bronze age of europe at leningrad university ) . he paid heed to the fact that the city excavated in hissarlyk is radically different from troy as described in the iliad . aside from the inconsistencies between text and reality , it might be wondered why the main heroes and other phenomena have double names . in the epic : troy is ilios , the river scamandre is also xanthos , the trojan prince is called sometimes paris , sometimes alexander ; the main heroes of greeks , achilles and diomedes , perceive the same deeds and even are wounded in the same spot and in the poem they do nt meet each other - when one emerges the other disappears . klejn reached the conclusion that germans of the 19th and early 20th centuries were right : the epic was put together from different songs having their own heroes . by means of           by distribution of epithets as well as by the distribution of words . in this manner it appeared possible to discern in the text 6 independent sources united in the epic as scattered parts interspersed with each other . further studies showed that the main heroes of iliad achilles , ajax , nestor and others were not historical personalities as they are presented in the epic but rather half-mythical cult heroes almost akin to christian saints , each responsible for a special sphere of life : achilles was a warden of ships , nestor a healer , odysseus a magician and fortune-teller and so on , and in the poem , however they are addressed , they are essentially occupied with their initial business . klejn came to the inference that there was no historical trojan war and no capture of troy by greeks . we possess not the slightest of archaeological proofs for these things , while , on the contrary , there are plenty of refutations . in general , epic is           ) are transformed into just the reverse : defeats turn out to be victories . the city excavated by schliemann is not troy at all , although it is ilios . in the hittite written sources two different towns are mentioned in the west of asia minor : truya this is troy , and wilusa this is greek ilios . in klejns books there are many maps , comparative tables and statistical charts . the most eminent russian historian of the ancient world igor m. dyakonov declared in print that klejns inferences are impossible to disprove and that possibly from these books a new epoch in homeric studies begins .  klejns anthropologic studies  klejn himself holds that his communication theory of cultural evolution is his most interesting contribution to anthropology , although he could not succeed in working out this theory in detail . many modern students imagine culture as a certain amount of information . but if so , then the transmission of culture from one generation to the next can be presented as a           alone . in that case , the flow of information will be exposed to the impact of the same factors as influence any chain of communication . in order that the information get through , we need repetition , a quantity of channels with a good transmission capacity etc . it remains to be worked out what cultural phenomena - promoting or hindering the transmission of information - correspond to these physical factors . for instance , channels of communication might include family , school , court , club , etc . the repetition of the cultural information might be daily , or weekly , etc .. it may be possible to include mathematical formulas of cultural evolution within this theory ; and it may be possible to use this theory in the present day for the , so to say , indirect direction of culture . there are explanatory uses for this theory in archaeology . for instance , with respect to the explanation of migration : if           warriors they simply could not learn from their homeland those forms of culture that were only seldom repeated , for example , burial customs . in such a case although a migration might have occurred we would not necessarily expect to find the wholesale transference of all forms of culture . in a number of works klejn discusses the idea of the contradiction between modern culture and the nature of man . this treatment is far from the rousseaus mood and is built on the basis of socio-biology . developing the ideas of lorenz and desmond morris , klejns idea is built upon the fact that in every stage of mans biological evolution man has been formed by adaptation to conditions not only of the natural environment but also of the socio-cultural milieu . however tempos of socio-cultural evolution are much faster than those of biological evolution : socio-cultural evolution has no need to wait for generations to change . while biological evolution has not terminated even a single stage of homo sapiens , socio-cultural evolution has gone through the upper palaeolithic , mesolithic , eneolithic , neolithic , bronze and           has now entered the atomic and computer age . yet our psycho-physiological characteristics remain the same as in the stone age they were , and are , adapted to those conditions . this accords with freuds observation : we are discontent with modern culture because we are not by our nature adapted to it . hence there are a number of specific deceases and psychic problems that are developing into social ones . yet in culture a number of compensatory mechanisms exist to diminish this tension . however , when in some milieus there is a lack of culture , from mans inside there bursts a savage , and thus society , when left to self-organization , restores primordial forms of life . this can be seen in the example of hard labour camps , bullying among army troops , etc .. this idea is worked out by klejn in the book the world turned upside down folklore , klejn first looked for historical remnants of an ancient intrusion of slavic paganism into the caucasus . he connected the traces of peruns cult not only with those sparse relics of this cult that were kept in russian culture but also with the wide circle of ethnographic phenomena of that culture . peruns cult appeared to be connected with images of rusalka , yarilo , kostroma and others . klejn interpreted perun himself to be a dying and resurrecting god . many other problems were also solved . so , maslenitsa appeared to be , according to klejn , not an ancient festival , but pagan solstice rites that were moved aside to make way for christian fasts . klejn considers veles to be a late deity imitating the christian st. vlasius . these positions are mainly expounded in the book resurrection of perun : an approach to the reconstruction of east-slavic pagan religion           , was published in 2010 . having also a musical education , in his student years klejn was the leader of a popular music group , in his teaching years he was responsible for amateur musical performances at the university . in the 70s he wrote a book on music where he established connections between rock and classical music , but the manuscript , having slipped into samizdat , had to be brought before the kgb and was not published at that time . it has not become obsolete . klejns reflections on music are of an anthropological character . he considers various systems of harmony and establishes their correspondence to the social psychology of different epochs . many systems of classical music influence , and have their equivalents , in popular music . the book is not written exclusively for professional musicians : it is in accessible language . after klejn was accused of homosexual relations , he became interested in the question of homosexuality in general and began to study it . approaching it as an anthropologist , he classifies the question as falling under the           to the conclusion that homosexuality is not in any way contagious and is not inherited through the male line , that in different societies and in different epochs its distribution is approximately equal , only the degree of reticence varies . klejn consistently advocates its decriminalisation and de-medicalisation but at the same time , as distinct of other liberal figures , he a ) considers homosexuality in its biological respect a pathology ; b ) he does not consider gay-pride actions to be reasonable and appropriate ; c ) he is sharply critical of the homosexual sub-culture . his book the other love considers various theories and views on homosexuality from ancient times to the present , theories about the origins of homosexuality , and the evolution of homosexuality in various societies and in various historical periods . the book another side of the luminary considers the unusual love of outstanding personalities . specifically           well-known russian figures , from ivan the terrible to rudolf nureev . still in manuscript there is a third book devoted to non-russian figures , from socrates and plato to leonardo and president lincoln . the aim of the book is not to justify homosexuality by referencing famous homosexuals but rather to consider how outstanding personalities coped with this difficult psychological problem not all of them are regarded as positive figures . among klejns entire works this topic occupies a relatively small space , but it is reasonable to provide brief expositions of these books because on the internet these books have been frequently reproduced , but in a misleading way usually without the inclusion of critical chapters - and so give a false impression .  klejns influence  one may sometimes meet the expression klejns school . however , klejn himself withholds judgement as to whether such a school exists is a matter of convention : it is dependent upon what is taken as a school . yet his impact on archaeology is undoubted and is underlined by the calling of a discussion           in england . this will be devoted to klejns contribution to russian , european and world archaeology . a number of known scholars had the experience of klejns seminar : v. s. bochkarev , v. a. safronov , m. b. shchukin , g. s. lebedev , v. a. bulkin , b. a. raev , yu.yu . piotrovsky , i. v. dubov , e. n. nosov , yu . m. lesman , l. b. vishnyatsky , e. m. kolpakov , o. a. shcheglova , a. d. rezepkin , v. ya . stegantseva , v. a. dergachev , a. a. kovalev , a. m. smirnov , s. zh . pustovalov , and many others . v. a. lynsha and other students who came to leningrad from other universities , in order to supplement their training , also established themselves as klejns pupils . those who studied under klejns guidance or experienced his influence were not only archaeologists ; there were , among others , also the philosopher-logician b. i. fedorov , the anthropologist a. g. kozintsev , the linguist n. n. kazansky , the orientalist m. a. rodionov , the art historian v.           ideas affected the whole of leningrad-petersburg archaeology as well as many archaeologists in northwest russia , siberia , ukraine and moldavia ; archaeologists in moscow were also affected by klejns work to the extent that it was through him that ideas from outside of russia became known . as concerns relations with western archaeology , in the most difficult years for international cooperation it was klejn who showed to world archaeologists that soviet archaeology was nevertheless no longer from another planet . he supported the virtues of russian archaeology in that he demonstrated that it contained erudition , the urge toward objectivity and creative potentials .  political views  l. s. klejn is a convinced adherent of liberal values , and an adversary of xenophobia and nationalism . he is a whole-hearted supporter of civil rights , but his democratic ideal is qualified : he does not idealise egalitarianism and anarchy . his humanitarianism is also qualified : in his view charity should not stimulate parasitism and so do harm to society . he is unsatisfied with the oversimplified polar contraposition between patriotism and rusophobia .           . to him , such sort of patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel . proper patriotism is love of ones own country and people , and does not exclude esteem for other peoples . it is based on love and not hate . a sincere love is conjugated with the desire for ones people and country to reach towards perfection , and to correct the faults - and therefore to reveal them . and so criticism of a beloved people and country is not rusophobia but a proper patriotism , whereas the desire to hide defects reveals indifference to the people and the country , characteristic of populism and a slavish longing to serve those in power . in his article diagnosis  , klejn details the ongoing process of nazification of russia both from above and below .  selected bibliography  for a full bibliography see archaeology.ru and to 2000 arkheolog : detectiv i myslitel . collection of studies devoted to 77th year of lev

really excited . i m probably going to be extra nervous the day before . we ve been working hard for , like , two months now , and everything s coming together really good . ... the show can be kind of grueling , especially when you re onstage and you re on your eighth number , you get really winded and you re like ,  how can i do the rest of the show ?  but i ve been training for a while and i actually before i come to rehearsals i ve been working out and stuff like           after minaj was announced as the opening act in april 2011 , she said on ryan seacrest s radio show she was looking forward to creating a new , a bigger , a brighter , a more spectacular show . in july 2011 , spears told mtv news she was having a blast on the tour , commenting , the shows have been equally amazing . the crowds have been so good each night and that gives you the adrenaline you need to get through the show . it just pumps you up . she also talked about the performance of till the world ends , saying that at the end of the show , the last song minaj comes on every once . not every show , but it s usually special when she does it . in an interview with   glamour   in october 2011 , spears

onstage .  critical response  barry walters from   rolling stone   called the show possibly her flashiest , fastest moving , and most entertaining production yet , and added that the night belonged to spears , as she managed to prove that she s still progressing as a showgirl . not only that , she s doing it better than even diehard defenders wouldve predicted . at 29 , the pop star whose career           has shown that she s back hopefully this time to stay . evelyn mcdonnell of   spin   said that the idol america loves to hate went all out . her body perpetually moved , she sang steadfastly into her headset , and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits . ... having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years , spears is now desperately seeking our attention . and she earns it . haters go home . kelley l. carter of mtv commented that the spears that captivated the audience at the staples center ... was the old , fun-loving , free-wheeling spears with a sexy , showgirl twist . there was nt much pretense , though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible . instead , there was just good dance music . carla meyer of   the sacramento bee   stated that though spears performed like a pro throughout the show , hitting all her marks           the first stop on a tour . but that hesitancy vanished when she put on the denim . she seemed at ease . shaunna murphy of   entertainment weekly   criticized britney s complete lack of verbal audience interaction ... and her obviously diminished dancing ability but also added that with her slim waist , her dangerously toned legs , and most importantly her engaged , wide-eyed smile , spears looked happy to be there with usthe crucial element that has been missing from so many britney shows of late . august brown of the   los angeles times   stated that the femme fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing or at least tweaking the past . ... spears manipulates pops virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone , and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of  do nt let me be the last to know  ... felt true to the sweep of her career she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club s heat or into             commented , though visually impressive , the show lacked a truly engaging human quality . spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment , lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself . with her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks , she appeared onstage as some strange blend of michael jackson , madonna and kraftwerk s ralf and florian . however ,   jam ! canoe   considered the show best described as janet jackson-like . steve palopoli of   metro silicon valley   said , musically , the show is heavy on the hits , although considering britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of madonna s albums is best . she s a cultural phenomenon , obviously , and the only edicts that seem to have been handed down in regards to the music is  no lip-synching  and  bigger and louder whenever possible .  shirley halperin of   the hollywood reporter   stated it was entertaining , but spears does nt quite have           a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits . jim harrington of the   oakland tribune   deemed the show as a mess pretty much from start to finish . the theatrics are awkward and confusing , the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat , the song selection is weak and misguided , and britney s star power , so blinding on tours past , is remarkably dim . alexis petridis of   the guardian   gave the show two stars out of five , saying that there s a suspicion that the kind of person who goes to see britney spears live is nt really there for the music or her sparkling personality : tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever . what they re interested in is proximity to a global celebrity . neil mccormick of   the daily telegraph   gave the show one star out of five , and called it the saddest , laziest , dullest and most tawdry pop concert i have ever witnessed . he added that the most           of people , having forked out around 50 a head for tickets , practically raised the roof , cheering every dismal dance move , roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica .  commercial reception  live nation announced in early may 2011 a partnership with deal-of-the-day website groupon . a spokesperson explained , offering a deal on groupon is not a reflection of the quality or status or sales of a show but rather segmented marketing and a way to reach new and additional consumers . a staff editor for vh1 noted that as of june 16 , 2011 , 18,000 tickets were sold at discounted prices through groupon for fifteen of the first twenty-four dates of the tour , including 1,800 at opening night in sacramento . the groupon deals for shows in seattle , winnipeg , saint paul , and atlanta actually expired before all available discounted tickets were sold . the editor also stated that the shows look to be under-attended in smaller cities , even as , in metropolitan areas like greater new york city , new shows have been added . it remains           better price optimization , or whether the tours ambition was more outsized than its actual draw . the femme fatale tour was ranked at number fifty-five by pollstar on the top 100 north american tours list , grossing $6.2 million in the first ten shows . on july 22 , 2011 , the shows in atlanta and nashville ranked spears at number ten on   billboard s hot tours list , with a combined gross of $1,563,934 . on september 22 , 2011 , the tour was ranked at number six on the top 20 concert tours list from pollstar . it had an average gross of $940,165 per city , and an average ticket price of $84.19 during the shows in north america . worldwide , the femme fatale tour was the eleventh highest-grossing tour of 2011 , with a gross of $68.7 million . 697,957 fans attended the shows worldwide , with an average attendance of 8,724 , paying an average of $98.43.  broadcast and recordings  in july 2011 , a high-quality recording of the las vegas show was uploaded to youtube . on july 14           the recording industry association of america , marc mcdevitt , requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from youtube of the user who uploaded the video , including the ip address , e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person . although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to youtube , it is thought to be the first time the riaa filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader . the case was closed after a week ; according to a copyright lawyer , it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that youtube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested . the video was removed from youtube , but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site . on august 12 , 2011 , spears announced through her twitter account that the toronto shows at the air canada centre would be taped to air on the epix television channel , and for release           to epix social sites doubled and britney spears became a worldwide trending topic on twitter . the show , initially titled   britney spears : femme

filmmaker jeannot szwarc directed it . though the season 3 finale was scheduled to be just an hour long , executive producer jeff pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be linked in one continuous story arc . this was a reflection of pinkner and fellow executive producer j.h. wyman s intent to have the last three episodes of every season seem like you re turning the last page of a chapter in a novel . and usually in a good novel , the last pages of a chapter compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you cant wait to turn that page . some media outlets have referred to the episodes as a three-part third-season finale . during a conference call with journalists , actor john           of the third season an epic trilogy . he elaborated all year we ve been heading toward the fact that there seems to be an inevitable conflict between the two universes . and we ve gotten to know the people on both sides now , so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with  6:02 .  by the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate . events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading . and so everyone has to move into another gear and say ,  okay , this problem is not going to go away . it s now affecting our side . we do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem .  and so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy , leading up to the use of that machine . in the same interview , noble called the episode s title very critical to the series , stating that time frame plays through the three episodes           finale , that time frame . in march 2011 , tvline s michael ausiello exclusively confirmed that previous guest actor kevin corrigan would be returning for the twentieth and twenty-first episodes of the season . corrigan last appeared in the season s twelfth episode concentrate and ask again ; his role in 6:02 am est and the following week s episode the last sam weiss marked his sixth and seventh appearances on   fringe   , respectively . as with other   fringe   episodes , fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with science olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in 6:02 am est , with the intention of having students learn about weather forecasting . ironically , the sunny post-daybreak conditions depicted as occurring at the time used as the episode s title can not ever occur anywhere in new york state under the daylight saving time rules used in the contemporary united states . even on the very first days of the period in the autumn when dst ends and new           yet risen over any part of the state . the same is true on the last day of standard time in the spring . a better title for the episode would have thus have been 6:02 am edt .  reception   ratings  on its initial broadcast in the united states , the episode was watched by an estimated 3.51 million viewers , with a 1.2/4 ratings share for those aged 1849 . it was seen by 14 percent fewer viewers than the previous week , though several other series airing that night were also down in viewers . the 1.2 ratings share resulted in a series low for   fringe   .  reviews  the a.v. club s noel murray graded the episode with an a- , explaining that though he did not want to give a full review until the season finale aired , he was enjoying how   fringe            cross-cutting between earth-1 and earth-2 , and the sense of imminent doom . murray continued that he especially liked .. that in the midst of all this end-times rush , it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes , strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean . writing for the   los angeles times   , critic andrew hanson noted   fringe   is preparing for the finale , calling 6:02 am est a movement episode that gives an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax in a vein similar to the television series   lost   . hanson enjoyed the two sleights of hand , explaining he was surprised by fauxlivia s universe-crossing device failing and what happened to peter after touching the machine . ign s ramsey isler rated the episode 7.5/10 , writing this week s episode           high marks for character development and putting the pieces in place for a great season finale . like hanson , isler loved the outcome of peter and the machine , calling it a nice plot twist ; he also praised blair brown as one of the many under-appreciated elements of the series . writing for mania.com , critic kurt anthony krug acknowledged the episode had a tough act to follow after the previous week s episode , but stated it s still pretty good . sarah stegall from sfscope was happy to see peter taking a more active role with the machine plotline , but disliked the episode s religious elements , believing that walter s scene in the church felt forced . stegall concluded her review noting this episode felt like the first part of a chess game , as the pieces are arranged on the board . the big move is coming up , the endgame that will decide who wins and who loses .

the tshuapalomamilualaba conservation landscape was until very recently a remarkably unknown forested region in central democratic republic of congo .  geography  this landscape is known by three principal rivers , the tshuapa , the lomami , and the congo river , known here as the lualaba , giving the region its name : tl2 . the tshuapa and lualaba are its western and eastern borders ; the lomami river flows through its center . this region covers over 40,000 km and is one of the largest blocks of intact forest in drcongo . it has both low human population densities and little immigration .  fauna  the most important populations of key fauna , including bonobo and elephant , occur in a central area that can be divided into three linked conservation sectors . two primary conservation sectors , include one in maniema province and one in orientale province . along with a third smaller sector in kasai oriental , surveys show that this region holds a major population of congo s great ape , the bonobo , as well as the           rivers . the concentrations of these two flagship species also correspond with the highest concentrations of many other large mammals , including primates , throughout this continuously forested landscape . the forests in the lomami-lualaba watersheds are the eastern range limit of congos endemic great ape , the bonobo . bonobos are found throughout most of tl2 , though occurrence is patchy and bonobos are uncommon in some areas where they are present . the largest concentrations of bonobos are found in the south of the landscape , toward the forest-savanna ecotone . bonobos were recorded in only a few scattered locations in surveys outside the area defined as the tl2 conservation landscape , and the evidence suggests populations are small and scattered . based on interviews with hunters and villagers , bonobos have disappeared from some of these areas over the last two decades as hunting levels increased . forest elephants in the landscape are now restricted mainly to a single area in the watershed of the tutu river , a tributary of the lomami . it is an area of approximately           all highly mobile , occur elsewhere in the landscape . there is a reasonable prognosis for maintenance of forest elephants over the long term , but existing populations were nearly decimated after a decade of intense poaching , associated with the war and the widespread availability of military-grade firearms . okapi occur on both sides of the lomami river , representing an extension of the species known range . okapi are , however , uncommon in the landscape .  primates  several species or subspecies of primates are limited in their distribution to the tl2 landscape region . a new species of primate , known vernacularly as the lesula , was discovered in this region in 2007 . the lesula is most closely related to the owl-faced monkey ,   cercopithecus hamlyni   . significant work was subsequently undertaken over the next five years to complete the taxonomic classification of the new species and confirm the importance and significance of the discovery . on 13 september 2012 , the discovery of the lesula was announced to have been confirmed .           genomic evidence .  references

full name =   jennings v rice   2002 is an english contract law case concerning proprietary estoppel.  facts  mr jennings , a gardener , sued the administrator of his former employer , mr rice , to have a large house worth 435,000 conveyed to him on the ground that he had been given an assurance he would get it . mrs royle , who lived at lawn house , shapwick , somerset , died on august 11 , 1997 aged 93 , without a will or children . mr jennings had worked as her gardener since 1970 , but from the late 1980s had increasingly begun to care for her , doing washing , helping dressing , shopping and going to the toilet . she was running out of money and could not continue to pay him . she told him he need not worry about that since he would be alright and that this will all be yours one day . mr jennings claimed that either there was a claim under the inheritance act 1970 , or there was a contract ,           the doctrine of proprietary estoppel . the administrator contested the payment . the high court awarded him 200,000 taking into account the payments mr jennings had forgone on the basis of proprietary estoppel , after rejecting the ia 1970 claim , and stating that mrs royle s words had been too vague to make a contract . mr jennings appealed arguing that he should get the full sum even under proprietary estoppel , while mr rice argued that although the full value of the house was the maximum awardable , the court should take into account the actual detriment experienced .  judgment  the court of appeal held that the high court had made a correct assessment , and proportionality was essential between expectation and detriment in deciding how to satisfy an equity based on proprietary estoppel . although the detriment to mr jennings was more difficult to establish than his expectation , courts must consider unconscionability . in agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed , robert walker lj said the following . 43 . it can not be doubted that in this as in every other area of           , and can not exercise a completely unfettered discretion according to the individual judge s notion of what is fair in any particular case . dr gardner s fourth hypothesis can not be right . i do not think that the judgment of hobhouse lj in   sledmore v dalby   72 p&amp;cr 196 can possibly be regarded as adopting or advocating an unfettered judicial discretion . 44 . the need to search for the right principles can not be avoided . but it is unlikely to be a short or simple search , because proprietary estoppel can apply in a wide variety of factual situations , and any summary formula is likely to prove to be an over-simplification . the cases show a wide range of variation in both of the main elements , that is the quality of the           the extent of the claimant s detrimental reliance on the assurances . the doctrine applies only if these elements , in combination , make it unconscionable for the person giving the assurances to go back on them . 45 . sometimes the assurances , and the claimant s reliance on them , have a consensual character falling not far short of an enforceable contract act 1989 , the proprietary estoppel may become indistinguishable from a constructive trust :   yaxley v gotts   2000 ch 162 ) . in a case of that sort both the claimant s expectations and the element of detriment to the claimant will have been defined with reasonable clarity . a typical case would be an elderly benefactor who reaches a clear understanding with the claimant . in a case like that the consensual element of what has happened suggests that the claimant and the benefactor probably regarded the expected benefit and the accepted detriment as being equivalent , or at any rate not obviously disproportionate . cases of that sort , if free from other complications , fit fairly comfortably into dr gardner s first or second hypothesis . 46 . however the claimant s expectations may not be focused on any specific property . in   re basham   1986 1 wlr 1489 the deputy judge rejected the submission that there must be some clearly identified piece of property , and that decision has been approved more than once in this court . moreover the claimant s expectations may have been formed on the basis of vague and inconsistent assurances . the judge said of mrs royle that she .. was prone to saying different things at different times and , perhaps deliberately , couched her promises in non-specific terms . he made that observation in relation to the failure of the contract claim , but it is relevant to the estoppel claim also . 47 . if the claimant s expectations are uncertain then their specific vindication can not be the appropriate test . a similar problem arises if the court , although satisfied that the claimant has a genuine claim , is not satisfied that the high level of the claimant s expectations is fairly derived from his deceased patron s assurances , which may have justified only a lower level of expectation . in such cases the court may still take the claimant s expectations as a starting point , but unless constrained by authority i would regard it           i do not see that approach as being inconsistent with authority . on the contrary , i think it is supported by a substantial body of english authority . scarman lj s well-known reference to the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff must no doubt be read in the context of the rather unusual facts of that case , but it does not stand alone . as scarman lj recognised , the line of authority goes back to nineteenth-century cases such as   duke of beaufort v patrick   17 beav.60 and   plimmer v wellington corporation   9 app cas 699 . a passage in the opinion of the privy council in plimmer s case at pp.713-4 is particularly instructive . the conclusion of the passage is that in fact the court must look at the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied . scarman lj s reference           constitutionally parsimonious , but it does implicitly recognise that the court must also do justice to the defendant . 49 . it is no coincidence that these statements of principle refer to satisfying the equity . the equity arises not from the claimant s expectations alone , but from the combination of expectations , detrimental reliance , and the unconscionableness of allowing the benefactor to go back on the assurances . there is a faint parallel with the old equitable doctrine of part performance , of which lord selborne said in   maddison v alderson   8 app cas 467 , 475 , in a suit founded on such part performance , the defendant is really  charged  upon the equities resulting from the acts done in execution of the contract , and not upon the contract itself . so with proprietary estoppel the defendant is charged with satisfying the equity which has arisen from the           faint since in the case of estoppel there is no contract and the nexus between the benefactor s assurances and the resulting equity is less direct ; the assurances are only half the story . in   dillwyn v llewelyn   4 de g f &amp; j 517 , 522 lord westbury expressed the point in terms which anticipated lord selborne : the equity of the donee and the estate to be claimed by virtue of it depend on the transaction , that is , on the acts done , and not on the language of the memorandum which amounted to an imperfect gift . 50 . to recapitulate : there is a category of case in which the benefactor and the claimant have reached a mutual understanding which is in reasonably clear terms but does not amount to a contract . i have already referred to the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor s house , either outright or for life . in such a case the court s natural response is to fulfil the claimant s           , or extravagant , or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered , the court can and should recognise that the claimant s equity should be satisfied in another way . 51 . but that does not mean that the court should in such a case abandon expectations completely , and look to the detriment suffered by the claimant as defining the appropriate measure of relief . indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify , in financial terms , than the claimant s expectations . detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person s house , and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity . but the detriment of an ever- increasing burden of care for an elderly person , and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes , is           claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor s assurances , and may receive some countervailing benefits . in such circumstances the court has to exercise a wide judgmental discretion . 52 . it would be unwise to attempt any comprehensive enumeration of the factors relevant to the exercise of the court s discretion , or to suggest any hierarchy of factors . in my view they include , but are not limited to , the factors mentioned in dr gardner s third hypothesis . to these can safely be added the court s recognition that it can not compel people who have fallen out to live peaceably together , so that there may be a need for a clean break ; alterations in the           s assurances have been given , and the claimant s detriment has been suffered , over a long period of years ; the likely effect of taxation ; and the other claims on the benefactor or his or her estate . no doubt there are many other factors which it may be right for the court to take into account in particular factual situations . 53 . the judge did in this case consider , although not in detail , what mr jennings might reasonably have earned in the way of arm s length remuneration for his services . he also considered what professional nursing care might have cost during the last eight years of mrs royle s life . a detailed computational approach was adopted by the supreme court of tasmania in   public trustee v wadley   1997 7 tas . lr 35 in which the court discussed the appropriate hourly rate and the total number of hours of housework undertaken by           dissenting judgment of wright j ) had subordinated her own life to that of her father and whose attentive and affectionate service , often no doubt at considerable inconvenience to herself , put her assistance on a higher plane than that of a domestic servant . 54 . that illustrates the australian preference for compensating the reliance loss only . under english law that approach may sometimes be appropriate but only where , on the facts , a higher measure would amount to overcompensation . in my view it would rarely if ever be appropriate to go into detailed inquiries as to hours and hourly rates where the claim was based on proprietary estoppel . but the going rate for live-in carers can provide a useful cross-check in the exercise of the court s discretion . 55 . i have made some references to the general trend of australian jurisprudence in this area . it is unnecessary to attempt any detailed study of the different views expressed by the high court in           the very different context of litigation arising out of personal injuries suffered in a collision between two warships ) or of australian cases since then . 56 . however i respectfully agree with the view expressed by hobhouse lj in   sledmore v dalby   72 p&amp;cr 196 , that the principle of proportionality , emphasised by mason cj in verwayen , is relevant in england also . as hobhouse lj observed at p.209 , to recognise the need for proportionality .. is to say little more than that the end result must be a just one having regard to the assumption made by the party asserting the estoppel and the detriment which he has experienced . the essence of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel is to do what is necessary to avoid an unconscionable result , and a disproportionate remedy can not be the right way of going about that . cases on interim injunctive relief have recognised the importance of proportionality in the granting of equitable remedies : see for instance   lock international v beswick            court is granting final relief after investigating all the facts proportionality is even more important . 57 . i do not consider that the judge made any error of law in his approach to the exercise of his discretion , or that it was otherwise flawed . he did make an error in his reference to the quantum of the relief granted in gillett v holt . but every case depends on its own facts and that slip can not in my view have played a significant part in the judge s disposal of the case . 58 . i would therefore dismiss this appeal .
neuropathy target esterase also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6 is a neuropathy target esterase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the   pnpla6   gene . neuropathy target esterase is a phospholipase that deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine . it is thought to function in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neuronal differentiation . the protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum in both neurons and non-neuronal cells .  function  neuropathy target esterase is an enzyme with phospholipase b activity : it sequentially hydrolyses both fatty acids from the major membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine , which generates water-soluble glycerophosphocholine . in cells of eukaryotes from yeast to humans , nte is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is particularly abundant in neurons , the placenta , and the kidney . loss of nte activity results in abnormally elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine in brain and impairment of the constitutive secretory pathway in neurons . in kidney , the expression of neuropathy target esterase is regulated by tonebp as part of           clinical significance  mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia , and the protein is the target for neurodegeneration induced by organophosphorus compounds and chemical warfare agents . recessively-inherited mutations in   nte   that substantially reduce its catalytic activity cause a rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia , in which distal parts of long spinal axons degenerate leading to limb weakness and paralysis . organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy a paralysing syndrome with distal degeneration of long axons results from poisoning with neuropathic organophosphorus compounds that irreversibly inhibit nte.
organocerium compounds are chemical compounds that contain one or more chemical bond between carbon and cerium . organocerium chemistry is the corresponding science exploring properties , structure and reactivity of these compounds . in general , organocerium compounds are not isolable , and are rather studied in solution via their reactions with other species . there are notable exceptions , such as the cp* 3 ce complex shown at right , but they are relatively rare . complexes involving cerium of various oxidation states are known : though lanthanides are most stable in the +3 state , complexes of cerium have been reported . these latter compounds have found less widespread use due to their oxidizing nature , and the majority of literature regarding organometallic cerium complexes involves the +3 oxidation state . in particular , organocerium compounds have been developed extensively as non-basic carbon nucleophiles in organic synthesis . because cerium is relatively non-toxic , they serve as an environmentally friendly alternative to other organometallic reagents . several reviews detailing these applications have been published .  structure  the solution structure of organocerium reagents           heavily on the manner in which it is prepared . in particular , those derived from organolithium reagents likely are believed to form something similar to a  true  organocerium structure , r-cecl 2 , while those derived from grignard reagents are more appropriately characterized as -ate complexes of the form r-mgxcecl 3 . furthermore , the solvent seems to alter the solution structure of the complex , with differences noted between reagents prepared in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran . there is evidence that the parent chloride forms a polymeric species in thf solution , of the form ce 2 2 n , but whether this type of polymer exists once the organometallic reagent is formed is unknown .  preparation  organocerium compounds are typically prepared via transmetallation from the respective organolithium or grignard reagent . the most common cerium source for this purpose is cerium chloride , which can be obtained in anhydrous form via dehydration of the commercially available heptahydrate . precomplexation with tetrahydrofuran           with most procedures involving vigorous stirring for a period of no less than 2 hours . reagents derived from alkyl , alkynyl , and alkenyl organometallic reagents as well as cerium enolates have been described . the stability of each is approximately the same regardless of origin , with the exception of alkenyl reagents , which tend to be more stable when derived from the corresponding lithiate . the reasons for this are still poorly understood . functional groups compatible with the parent organometallic compound are generally also stable upon transmetallation to cerium . the figure below summarizes the kinds of organocerium compounds that have been prepared , highlighting several of the more  exotic  species reported in the literature .  reactions  organocerium reagents are used almost exclusively for addition reactions in the same vein as organolithium and grignard reagents . to this end , they have a number of particularly useful characteristics that distinguish them from their more common counterparts . they are incredibly nucleophilic , allowing additions to imines in the absence of additional lewis acid catalysts , making them           this high reactivity , organocerium reagents are almost entirely non-basic , tolerating the presence of free alcohols and amines as well as enolizable -protons . the oxophilicity of cerium imparts strong 1,2-selectivity in reactions with conjugated electrophiles similarly to organolithium reagents . at the same time , organocerium reagents can be used to synthesize ketones from acyl compounds without over-addition , as seen with organocuprates . this dichotomy illustrates the unique reactivity of organolanthanide reagents . finally , organocerium reagents have been employed in a number of total syntheses . shown below is a key coupling step in the total synthesis of roseophilin , a potent antitumor antibiotic .

the dedication of the basilicas of the apostles peter and paul is a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the catholic church , which is celebrated on 18 november . this feast combines the standard celebration of the dedication of a church for st. peter s basilica and the basilica of saint paul outside the walls , which were both built by the emperor constantine the great during the 4th century . these sites had already been visited by pilgrims for over a century when the basilicas were built to honor the apostles traditionally believed to have been buried there . the basilicas were originally joined by a colonnade , which was built despite the distance of several miles between them . their significance in the catholic church is emphasized in the reference made to them in the obligation on catholic bishops to make a   quinquennial visit ad limina   in which they are required to go to the tombs of the apostles in rome every five years to report on the status of their dioceses or prelatures . this requirement was initially set           the papal bull   romanus pontifex   , which established the norms for these visits . on 31 december 1909 , pope pius x decreed that a bishop needs to report to the pope an account of the state of his diocese once every five years , starting in 1911.

the ritz theater is located in the city of newburgh , new york . the theater is the last remaining historic theater in the city . the legendary building has a rich history of notable performances , and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization .  history  the original structure that would become the home of the ritz theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 broadway in newburgh , new york . the address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of lifes small luxuries : george barnes plumbing business .. a cigar factory .. and even a champagne factory.  1900s  in 1913 , the intended manufacturing building was purchased by george cohen , a poughkeepsie entrepreneur , and was named cohens opera house . the opera house opened on february 4 , 1913 . the opera house welcomed performers of all arts : jugglers , singers , dance troupes , theater companies , etc . the east-west theater company became a part of the theater and changed the theaters name from cohens opera house to the state theater in           the vaudeville theatrical genre that was extremely popular at the time . in 1933 eugene levy purchased the theater from george cohen and converted that playhouse of a gaudier era into an institution where cinematic and variety productions of the highest standard were presented with amazing skill , and affording the fascinated beholder the ultimate in comfort and convenience . this would begin a new era for the ritz theater , which became a frequent stomping ground of many big name stars such as : ella fitzgerald , louis prima , mary martin , peggy lee , wood herman , dick powell , bill bojangles robinson , eddy duchin , red skeleton , xavier cugat , the inkspots , vaughn monroe , montana slim , les brown , ricardo crotez , and many more . on november 3 , 1940 , frank sinatra , an unknown singer at the time , stepped onto the ritz theaters stage . the band of tommy dorsey backed sinatra who captivated the newburgh audience . the ritz theater is most notably famous for being the stage where lucille ball made her stage debut . on           on stage and for the first time with her new husband , desi arnaz . it was on the ritz stage that they planted the seeds for their sitcom ,   i love lucy   . shows were brought to the ritz theater by new york citys paramount theater to test their acts on the newburgh audience before opening in new york city . although the ritz theater continued to show movies , in the 1960s both the city of newburgh and its once highly popular street of broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city . the popular city of newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed , and i-84 as well as the newburgh-beacon bridge by-passed the downtown area of newburgh . in october 1969 , the ritz theater was closed , and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas . cinemas one and two were carved into the house and the stage was closed and walled off from the rest of the structure . in 1981 both of the cinemas were           inside the theater and the owner of cinemas one and two , abram and eva levinson , quit newburgh .. quietly closing up shop . in february 1999 , the movie theater was reopened by a former owner ; however , the theater was quickly closed again for good in june of the same year due to lack of business . throughout this span of seventeen weeks in business , the theater only had 700 customers .  2000s  in 2002 , the ritz theater was purchased by patricia haggerty-wenz , founder and executive director of safe harbors of the hudson , which is a nonprofit organization that is committed to transforming lives and building communities through housing and the arts in the city of newburgh . the organization stumbled upon the theater in the process of restoring the adjacent former hotel newburgh , which is now the cornerstone residence , a supportive-housing facility . haggerty-wenz s mission for the only remaining historic theater in the city of newburgh , is to provide a venue for live performances in a city that has none , educational programs for our youth           active cultural and tourist destination . this combination project , according to haggerty-wenz , is the only one in the country that combines the restoration of a historic theater with a supportive housing project , all under one roof . with haggerty-wenz and safe harbors of the hudson being the new owner of the establishment , the renovation of the ritz theater lobby began . the renovation of the supportive housing project called the cornerstone residence adjacent to the theater occurred from 2004-2006 . the cornerstone residence consists of 128 apartments ; 116 are supportive housing units and twelve are artist lofts . the apartments house a mixed tenancy of single adults , including formerly homeless , veterans , those living with a mental health diagnosis and/or physical disability , artists and other adults who need safe , attractive affordable housing . in 2008 , safe harbors of the hudson created a nonprofit organization called ritz theater-newburgh , inc . the mission of this particular nonprofit organization was to focus exclusively on the restoration of the ritz theater . a new era bloomed within the theater . it began hosting live           as : levi kreiss , pete seeger and odair assad . the performances were part of the tom humphrey guitar series . in 2009 , ritz theater-newburgh , inc. continued providing programming and performances in the restored lobby from artists such as : bucky pizzarelli , arturo ofarrill , the michele ramo group , jesse lege , and many others . as well as providing performances in the lobby , the organization also focused on raising funds to restore the original theater to what it was . in july of the same year , congressman maurice hinchey secured a federal appropriations bill which included 400,000 to begin renovating the ritz theater , the last remaining historic theater in newburgh . in 2010 , the tom humphrey guitar series continued to perform featuring artists such as : larry coryell , maria zemantauski and duke robillard . in october and november , cindy cashdollar and frederic hand performed and the second annual ritzkidz newburghs got talent talent show was held . in february of the same year , the ritz theater secured 200,000 dollars in funding from the new york state division of           was directed towards the building of a box office .  future  the completion of the reconstruction of the ritz theater is proposed to be completed in 2014 . after the theater is finished , it will hold 825 people . there are a few nonprofit performing arts organizations who hope to make the newly renovated ritz theater their home ; such as : the greater newburgh symphony orchestra , the opera company of the highlands and the newburgh performing arts academy .

the farc files are computer files which according to the colombian government were retrieved from a revolutionary armed forces of colombia camp in ecuador , during a colombian raid into ecuador which sparked the 2008 andean diplomatic crisis . in may 2011 the supreme court of colombia ruled the farc files inadmissible as evidence due to their acquisition from abroad by the military , and in addition stated that the validity of the content could not be verified .  provenance and authenticity  the cross-border raid on the camp took place in the early hours of 1 march 2008 . on the afternoon of 2 march 2008 , in a short press release , general scar naranjo , director of the colombian national police , as spokesperson of the colombian government , announced that during the military operation on the colombia-ecuador border , several documents and three laptops had been retrieved along with the bodies of ral reyes and one of his lieutenants . copies of 13 documents were provided by general naranjo to reporters on           , two external hard drives , and three usb memory sticks ) were later handed to interpol on 10 march . during interpol s press conference on 15 may , the secretary general said : the eight seized computer exhibits contained more than 600 gigabytes of data , including 37,872 written documents , 452 spreadsheets , 210,888 images , 22,481 web pages , 7,989 email addresses , 10,537 multimedia files and 983 encrypted files . in non-technical terms , this volume of data would correspond to 39.5 million filled pages in microsoft word and , if all of the seized data were in word format , it would take more than 1,000 years to read at a rate of 100 pages per day .  interpol  the colombian administrative department of security reported that it had asked for interpol s technical support in order to decipher the seized farc computers . according to the das , interpol accepted the request and sent several experts to colombia . the final report was presented on may 15 . interpol s report said that it           laptops , although the initial colombian security force access to the data sources did not conform to international standards . the laptops had been booted and hard drives or usb sticks were viewed . president hugo chvez dismissed interpol s findings as a show of clowns , ridiculous given by a gringo , aggressive , corrupt and vagabond policeman , about which spending time on is not worthwhile . and threatened to revise both its economic and diplomatic relations with colombia . on june 15 , 2008 interpol issued a new press release in response to a statement by ecuador s foreign ministry that interpol considered to be incorrect . the press release stated that ecuador inaccurately suggests that interpol had not established whether the eight seized exhibits forensically examined by interpol s computer forensic experts had been recovered by colombian authorities on 1 march 2008 from a farc camp or belonged to raul reyes . in fact , based on a review of all the information and material provided by colombia , including a classified oral briefing , interpol was           report , that the seized computer exhibits it was requested to forensically examine were taken from the farc terrorist camp on 1 march 2008 and belonged to raul reyes . interpol also added : validating that the contents of the computer exhibits were not manipulated after their seizure by colombian authorities is not in any way , shape or form the same as saying that the contents of the user files are true and accurate . interpol therefore objects to those who suggest that interpol s report validates the source and accuracy of any particular document or user file contained therein . according to an unnamed independent german computer expert consulted by heise online , there would have been a possibility of introducing potentially manipulated disk images .  colombian supreme court  in may 2011 the supreme court of colombia dismissed a case against congressman wilson borja . the case rested on material from the farc files . the court ruled the material inadmissible as it had not been properly acquired by the judicial police , with the prosecutor general s office clarifying that no other power in the country           less when ignoring foreign authorities . the court also said that the validity of the content could not be verified , as the alleged emails had been copied into microsoft word documents and provided no indication of the sender or receiver . the ruling would affect a number of open cases where defendants were accused of farc collaboration based on farc files evidence .  allegations  the documents contained a letter from reyes to the high command of farc explaining that he had recently held meetings with the security minister of ecuador , gustavo larrea , representing president correa , who had indicated a desire to establish formal relations with the farc . in the letter , reyes conveys the following information to the high command : the intention of the ecuadorian government to replace police forces that do not accept the presence of the guerrilla organization in the area ; the request for the release of a hostage , perhaps the son of professor moncayo or someone else who may increase political action ; and the decision of ecuador to annul next year s license for the use of           s interior minister fernando bustamante dismissed these allegations as false . he stated that we are not going to accept such a thing . he added it is very easy to say something based on evidence that has not been scrutinized publicly or internationally . the next day , another set of documents , allegedly indicating a relationship between the farc and venezuela , was released . according to naranjo , the documents suggested that chvez had given the farc guerrillas us$300 million and was assisting the organization to obtain 50 kg of uranium . scar naranjo also said there was evidence that hugo chvez had received 100 million pesos when he was a jailed rebel leader . some of the documents , along with photographs obtained from reyes  laptops , were passed to the press . the vice president of colombia , francisco santos , claimed at a disarmament forum in geneva that the farc was planning to build a dirty bomb , although he presented no evidence to back up his allegations . a message to reyes subsequently found on one of the computers seems to indicate that           . a letter from the farc supremo manuel marulanda to the venezuelan president was released on march 4 . in this letter , marulanda thanks the venezuelan government for its assistance in the war against the colombian government and the lvaro uribe presidency which was supported by the united states . farc also offered their modest knowledge in defense of the bolivarian revolution in case of a gringo aggression , understood to mean assistance against a possible military action from the united states .  denials  venezuelan interior minister ramn rodrguez chacn denied the accusations and stated that they say that they find in that computer a letter from marulanda to our commander in chief . everybody already knows , the ones showed by our commander in chief . pay attention , venezuelan and colombian people , how they manage the manipulation and deception , that kind of santanderist technique and now with fascism . rodrguez chacn also stated that months before , venezuelan authorities had seized another computer , from the deceased narcotrafficker wilson varela , which in turn implicated colombian police and general scar           and business between that general and that mafia capo to not reveal important information . juan david naranjo was one of his links and adjutants , brother of general scar naranjo trujillo. said rodrguez chacn . he added that he had not previously made the documents public because of ethics . the affair that involved general naranjo s brother in drug trafficking had been widely known since may 2006 , when naranjo himself announced it to the press . the colombian government stated that it would present the documents to the organization of american states to demonstrate that venezuela and ecuador were supporting the farc , and thereby violating international law against the harboring of terrorists . president uribe stated that our un ambassador will announce that colombia intends to denounce hugo chvez , president of venezuela to the international criminal court , for sponsoring and financing people that commit genocide . on march 3 , ecuadorian security minister gustavo larrea admitted having met with farc , without specifying where . later that day , ecuador s government announced it was in very advanced talks with farc ,           to president rafael correa , the effort was thwarted by colombia s military operation . the colombian government rejected this argument , insisting that the captured computer documents revealed ecuador to be engaging in hostage trafficking for political means and political gain , by suggesting that it would rotate military personnel on the border in order to allow the farc to operate more freely .  newspaper revelations  on march 4 , the colombian newsweekly   revista semana   published the second of two special editions following the death of farc s ral reyes , presenting some of the documents said to have been found on the computers seized by the colombian government . the documents included several letters between farc commanders and the secretariat . on september 22 , 2007 , a clandestine meeting had been held between a member or a emissary of the secretariat and the president of venezuela in caracas , as inferred from a letter from je to the secretariat . on april 8 , 2007 , a daniel writes in a letter to members of the secretariat joaqun gmez and fabin ramrez           chupeta , a man with high acquisitive power to carry out an exchange of farc drugs for missiles . according to this document , chupeta has contacts in lebanon and his organization can handle the transport in two ways : via europe or via mexico . on october 4 , 2007 , ivn mrquez writes of a meeting with rodrguez chacn in which is discussed a meeting of commanders in venezuela , with security dealt with by venezuelan military forces and organised by rodrguez chacn , an expert on this kind of issues . if it takes place , president chvez will be accompanied by presidents ortega , morales and correa , which are patria o muerte . this meeting between chvez and marulanda became an issue following publication of these documents . on october 8 , 2007 , details about secret meetings between rodrguez chacn and the farc were recorded , dealing with a request for proof that ingrid betancourt was still alive . he would be thankful if we send a record with the voice of the           and piedad . a document dated december 23 , 2007 discusses the procedure for the release of two hostages in february 2008 . it also refers to a request from the french president nicolas sarkozy to chvez , asking marulanda to receive his emissary noe , whom farc believes to be a french intelligence agent . chvez asks for the release of ingrid betancourt , to which farc responds : we said that if we release her , we would run out of cards . a document dated january 18 , 2008 , records a meeting with ecuadorian security minister gustavo larrea and a request for the release of gustavo moncayo s son . on february 8 , 2008 , a message from ivn and ricardo to comrade manuel and the secretariat , tells of a meeting with ngel who had read a letter from manuel and would send a reply , adding that he has already readied the first 50 and has a time frame for completing up to 200 during the year . the letter goes on to mention possible business deals regarding           of gasoline in colombia , as well as taking from the dossier , the creation of a profitable investment company in venezuela . the document also mentions that president chvez is willing to receive 47 guerrilla prisoners and 500 jailed guerrillas in his territory , and that he plans to create a sort of contadora group , seeking to promote peace negotiations and the recognition of the farc as a belligerent force . if they agree to his proposal , chvez says that it would help to lessen the impact from a manipulated march against the farc , and that he would be willing to promote counter-marches for peace and the humanitarian exchange in several countries . a document dated february 16 , 2008 , mentions a deal involving 50 kg of uranium , which was going to be sold at 2.5 million usd per kilogram .  wider repercussions  on march 6 , 2008 viktor bout , an ex-kgb agent turned weapons dealer , was arrested in a luxury hotel in thailand during a raid staged by us dea agents and carried out by thai police forces . he           , the middle east and to the colombian terrorist group farc . sources in spain claimed that his arrest was made possible by information found on the captured computers , but this was contradicted by sources in colombia . the data found on the laptop computers included personal pictures of raul reyes and the guerrilla camp which was bombed in the attack . according to colombian officials , this information not only corroborated some of their previous suspicions but also led to several important discoveries about farc s inner activities and their entire international network . the information uncovered the way in which the farc leadership was involved in several criminal dealings , including the deaths in captivity of the 11 norte del valle deputies , as well as ties with notable drug dealers and colombian politicians . it led to the discovery of farc funds related to rodrigo granda hidden in costa rica and to the capture of rosario garca albert , a spanish woman who was believed to be the representative of the guerrilla group in spain and portugal . on march 25 , 2008 , colombian intelligence officers           officials , corroborated the alleged deal mentioned on reyes  captured computers . some important colombian figures , including liberal opposition senator piedad cordoba , faced prosecution by the authorities in 2008 for incriminating emails found on these laptops . a chilean government official offered his resignation after being tied with some of the documents found on these computers . the information that was uncovered related to the inner workings of the organization , its structure and channels of communication and was used to give the farc its biggest blow , in an intelligence operation which led to the liberation of ingrid betancourt and three american contractors in july 2008 . during the diplomatic crisis caused by the 2008 unrest in bolivia , the united states government froze the assets of several senior members of the venezuelan government : ex-interior minister ramn rodrguez chacn , senior disip director henry de jess rangel and military intelligence chief hugo armando carvajal barrios , accusing them of arming , supporting and financing the farc and their killing of innocents , according to information discovered on reyes  computers .

inc party members in other parts of the country such as mumbai s western suburbs of santacruz , malad           he said : i have seen the violence unleashed on your youth and women . by seeing what has happened here , i feel ashamed to be an indian . the state government is tormenting its own people . though inc party spokesman subodh srivastava said that several party leaders and workers were injured in the   lathicharge   by police at a number of places in the state during peaceful protest and demonstration . more than 10,000 workers and leaders were arrested across the state , the up government said that there was no impact as a result of the inc agitation and that only 135 people had been arrested in apprehension of breach of peace during the ensuing   chakka jam   in protest against gandhi s arrest . mayawati responded also to the gandhi agitation by saying : i would like to tell   yuvraj   that whatever struggle he has to do , he should do in his home first , as the decision is in the           not being heard in his own home and he is venting his frustration by indulging in mean dramatics . the same day his mother , sonia gandhi , visited her national constituency of rae bareli to review the implementation of such nationally sponsored rural employment and housing schemes as the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act where she called for better implementation of the various schemes such as to ensure that 100 days of employment would be provided to a maximum number of families . under the pretext of land acquisition , the action was read as having gathered pace as after other legislative elections . the   times of india   read the move as a bigger favour from jittery chief minister mayawati and that the subsequent free-for-all included inc staging anti-mayawati protests as well as bjp leaders trying not to be undone by also courting trouble on the basis of land-related strife everywhere ... giving politicians scope for photo ops . it also said that mayawati may have had a point in lobbing the land acquisition ball back into the centre s           only make her opponents look good for being martyred ; while it still question if the inc were genuinely friends of farmers , tribals ,   dalits   , et al .  corruption issues  a centre for media studies report showed that the corruption has increased in up . the central bureau of investigation said there was strong evidence against incumbent chief minister mayawati in a case about disproportionate assets for a public figure ; while samajwadi party leader mulayam singh yadav also has a case pending against him in a similar case . out of a total of 403 mlas , 143 face criminal charges . the chief election commissioner has raised concerns about the use of money in the election for some form of undue campaigning . after the ec imposed restrictions on the movement of unaccounted money , police checks across up netted over 12 crores in cash , several kilogrammes of silver and weapons , leading to the arrest of at least one person . the uttar pradesh government was also sent a notice by the national government for alleged corruption in mgnrega           . she has also been accused by former minister avdesh verma of selling party tickets in the election for rs. 4 crores . furthermore , the bsp also expelled badshah singh and babu singh kushwaha , who had been removed after cbi evidence of corruption , from the party on charges of corruption . during the tenure of the incumbent cm mayawati , opposition parties have accused her of constructing parks and statues of herself and other   dalit   icons such as ambedkar and kanshi ram in places such as noida and lucknow that cost the exchequer crores of rupees in the name of development and social upliftment for   dalit   s . the uttar pradesh government was also criticised by the supreme court for not halting the construction of the memorials . despite an order to do so . on 7 january the chief election commissioner s. y. quraishi ordered for the veiling of statues of all political figures except for mohandas gandhi , as well as veiling the bsp s symbol the elephant , in order to have a level playing field by           of gautam budh nagar , though chief electoral officer umesh sinha said the deadline was 15 january but the government should try and do so earlier in view of the implementation of code of conduct . however , in lucknow bsp activists were reported to have removed the a veil minutes after it had been installed . the bsp called the move as completely wrong and not justified . quraishi dismissed criticism of the order as ill-informed and add that he was surprised the order has been taken as something unusual . there is a model code of conduct which says there should be a level-playing field for all candidates and parties . on 9 january , social activist dheeraj singh filed a pil in the allahabad high court challenging the ec s order on the grounds that the elephants represent ganesha and veiling them could hurt public sentiment . on 11 january the high court dismissed the petition as withdrawn on technical grounds .  campaign  the inc s rahul gandhi started his campaign on 14 november 2011 before the announcement of the election phases , while mulayam singh           the ruling bsp for corruption and atrocities on people . rahul gandhi toured one of the most impoverished area of the country on 17 january , bundelkhand in lalitpur . he also visited mauranipur , chirgaon , jhansi and mahoba , where he was reportedly shown black flags over the issue of black money . he promised to bring change , while also questioning the bsp government s alleged corruption in the mgnrega scheme . prime minister manmohan singh addressed a rally in kanpur on 17 february where he alleged that the u.p . government is not cooperating with the national government in regards to infrastructure development despite receiving five times the funds demanded . he also criticised the incumbent government s alleged corruption and u.p .  s infrastructure woes . the reason behind this bad situation is that non- congress governments which came to power in the state in the last 22 years did not pay attention either to governance or the problems of the common man . the congress will win up elections . sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi will ensure congress  victory in up ... we           if the congress comes to power . there is a need to change this situation . you need a government which changes the shape of up and focuses on development by rising above caste and religious lines . congress led by sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi can provide such a government . the inc also got the endorsement of the jamiat ulama-i-hind . after the first three phases of voting the party was said to have been cautious about its expectations of winning the election . the bjp formally began its campaign on 10 january , but would start hosting public

the transalpine campaigns of the old swiss confederacy , known as   ennetbirgische feldzge   transmontane campaigns in swiss historiography , were military expeditions which resulted in the conquest of territories south of the alps , corresponding more or less to the modern canton of ticino , on the part of the old swiss confederacy . these territories were known as   ennetbirgische vogteien   or transmontane bailiwicks . the leventina was the first transalpine possession of the swiss cantons of uri and obwalden , acquired in 1403 . other territories were acquired in 1418 and 1419 . a first setback came with the battle of arbedo in 1422 , where the swiss were defeated by the duchy of milan , and in a treaty of 1426 , the border of the duchy was moved back to the gotthard pass . renewed campaigns took place in 1439 , 1441 and 1447 , until in 1449 the swiss were beaten again by troops of the golden ambrosian republic in the battle of castione . in 1466 , the duke of milan promised to grant the           act on his promise , and as the swiss were tied up in the burgundian wars he even formed a pact with the burgundians . this prompted uri to send an expedition to the leventina , which was greeted as liberators by the local population . the swiss tried to conquer bellinzona as well , but after a two weeks  siege gave up and returned home . the battle of giornico was for once a swiss victory , in which a force of uri of about 175 men , with the support of about 400 men from the local population , managed to rout a milanese army of 10,000 . from this time , the leventina was an undisputed possession of uri , while bellinzona remained under milanese control . in 1487 , the valais together with lucerne wanted to expand into the ossola . besieging domodossola and marauding the valleys , the swiss were decisively defeated by the ducal milanese at the battle of crevola in april 1487 . this was the situation at the beginning of the italian wars in 1494 . bellinzona was finally occupied by           by louis xii of france in 1503 . the battle of novara was a success for the swiss confederacy and the allied three leagues which secured their possessions of locarno , lugano , mendrisio , cuvio , travaglia , chiavenna , bormio , tre pievi and valtellina . the defeat in the battle of marignano set an end to swiss aspirations to further extend their possessions , but the peace of 1516 allowed them to keep their possessions , except for ossola which was handed back to milan . these   ennetbirgische vogteien   were governed partly by the entire confederacy , partly just by uri , schwyz and nidwalden throughout the early modern period . the valtellina , governed by the three leagues from 1512 , was lost to spain in the course of the   bndner wirren   , in 1639.  transalpine bailiwicks  overview of the transalpine bailiwicks : condominiums of the forest cantons of uri , schwyz and nidwalden : * blenio 147780 and from           1500 condominiums of the twelve cantons from 1512 : * valmaggia * lugano * locarno * mendrisio condominiums of the twelve cantons from 1512 , but were lost from the confederacy three years later and are now   comuni   of lombardy and piedmont : * travaglia * cuvio * ossola

though it is no longer practiced today , tonga s ancient religion was practiced for over 2000 years . missionaries arrived and persuaded king george tupou i to convert to christianity ; he ordered and strictly enforced that all tongans become christian and no longer practice the ancient polytheistic religion with its supreme god tangaloa.  pulotu  pulotu was the unseen world , the domain of the god or goddess hikuleo believed to be reached by sea . stories told of journeys to pulotu . tongans identify pulotu with the underworld ,   lolofonua   . pulotu is also identified with the cemetery or graveyard . long ago , it was believed that pulotu could be visited by a man to recover a dead wife . hikuleo would assemble the spirits so the wife could be found , reanimated and released . two entrances are pointed out by tongans . one is   ahole   a deep hole on the island of koloa , vavau . ahole was the opening from which   maui kisikisi   brought fire from the underworld           island of tofua . there are three divisions of pulotu called   pulotu tete   ,   pulotu  akaaka   , and   pulotu tuumau   .  gods and deities   tangaloa  tangaloa , the sky god , was regarded in vavau as the deity who hauled up the islands of the vavau group , his fish hook catching in what is now the island of   hunga   . the vavau people attributed this great act to tangaloa instead of maui due to the importance of tangaloa worship in vavau .   tangaloa tufunga   , though said not to be a god in niuatoputapu , is the patron of carpenters elsewhere in tonga .  maui  the   maui   were special men or demigods ; they appeared human . maui drew up the islands of ata , north of tongatapu , as well as tongatapu with all its associated islands , then lofanga and the other haapai islands , and lastly the vavau.
the minisci reaction is a named reaction in organic chemistry . it is a radical substitution to an aromatic compound , in particular to a heteroaromatic base , that introduces an alkyl group . the reaction was published about in 1971 by f. minisci . the aromatic compound is generally electron-deficient and with n-aromatic compounds the nitrogen atom is protonated . a typical reaction is that between pyridine and pivalic acid to 2-tert-butylpyridine with silver nitrate , sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate . the reaction resembles friedel-crafts alkylation but with opposite reactivity and selectivity . the minisci reaction proceeds regioselectively and enables the introduction of a wide range of alkyl groups . a side-reaction is acylation . the ratio between alkylation and acylation depends on the substrate and the reaction conditions . due to the simple raw materials and the simple reaction conditions the reaction has many applications in heterocyclic chemistry .  mechanism  a free radical is formed from the carboxylic acid in an oxidative decarboxylation with silver salts and an oxidizing agent . the oxidizing agent reoxidizes the silver salt . the radical then reacts           by rearomatisation . the acylated product is formed from the acyl radical .  references

governingbody = private the south school is a historic school building in the village of yellow springs , ohio , united states . over its history of more than 150 years , it has served a wide range of purposes , although it is not used now as a school . upon its completion in 1856 , the south school served one of the school districts of miami township . at that time , small schoolhouses covered greene county ; more than a hundred were still in existence into the late twentieth century . this position it held only for a short time ; just two years after its completion , it was converted for use as yellow springs high school ; at that time , only white students were permitted to attend . after fourteen years in the south school , the high school moved to a different property ; from 1872 until 1874 , no school typically met on the property . it was reopened in the latter year to serve as the black school , which purpose it served until 1887 . since its closure           . architecturally , the south school is a distinctive example of the greek revival style of architecture . constructed on a limestone foundation , it is built of brick and covered with a metal roof . among its most distinctive elements is the decorative brickwork that appears at certain points on the exterior ; such styling is common on buildings constructed during yellow springs  golden age in the mid-19th century , but is a stark difference from the county s other historic school buildings . architectural historians have seen the brickwork as an indication that the school was constructed by local brickmaker and contractor j.w. hamilton , who established his business in the community in 1848 and was an active part of the community for over thirty years . in 1984 , the south school was listed on the national register of historic places because of its important architecture and because of its place in local history . key to its place in local history is its use as a segregated school by two races .

the central asian orogenic belt is one of the largest accretionary orogens on earth and evolved over some 800 million years from the latest mesoproterozoic to the early triassic . it contains a record of geodynamic processes during one of the most important episodes of continental growth in phanerozoic time .  location  the caob stretches from the ural mountains to the pacific ocean , occupying an area of about 5.3 million square kilometers , about 11% of the asian surface area . it is bounded on the north by the siberian craton and on the south by the north china craton and the tarim craton , which provides substrate for the tarim basin . the caob encompasses parts of six nations : china , mongolia , russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , and uzbekistan . it includes mountain ranges north of tibet , including the tian shan where a good example of paleozoic arc accretion is exposed . the altai mountains of russia , kazakhstan , northwest china and western mongolia also           well exposed in kazakhstan , the south gobi range of southern mongolia , the beishan and inner mongolia of northern china , the sayan mountains of southern siberia just north of mongolia , the ranges of buratia in southern siberia south of lake baikal , and in the far east of china and russia .  geologic evolution  there has been much discussion about the tectonic evolution of the caob over the last two decades , and these interpretations fall into two general groups . one group of researchers suggests that the belt grew , in the neoproterozoic and palaeozoic , from the margin of the siberian craton to the south through accretion of island arcs and precambrian continental blocks until the evolution was terminated through collision with the north china and tarim cratons in the latest paleozoic to early mesozoic . the original paleogeographic position of the continental blocks is debated , but some studies suggest a gondwana affinity of many allochthonous terranes . the second group of researchers regards the caob as mainly composed of a huge paleozoic subduction-accretion complex , which accumulated against a single , long magmatic arc . the caob , like other major accretionary orogens , consists of :  accretionary wedges ;  island arc , forearc and back-arc systems , largely dismembered ophiolites , oceanic plateaux ;  blocks of older continental crust , ranging in age from archaean to neoproterozoic ;  synorogenic granite and metamorphic rocks including exhumed hp-uhp metamorphic rocks ,  clastic sedimentary basins ;  permian post-collisional granitoids and intraplate igneous suites . large-scale late paleozoic shear zones follow the orogenic grain . there are many controversies about caob tectono-magmatic evolution . one is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of caob igneous rocks . on one hand , the caob is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation since the neoproterozoic , because during its amalgamation           magmatic units , massive amounts of granitic magmas were generated with juvenile nd isotopic signatures . however , recently obtained detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages confirmed an important role for older crust in the orogens evolution . the modest neoproterozoic and huge early-middle paleozoic zircon age spectra matche caob crustal growth very well but older peaks of 1.8 ga and 2.7 ga suggest the involvement of older crust .  references  *dobretsov , n.l. , buslov , m.m. late cambrian-ordovician tectonics and geodynamics of central asia . russian geology and geophysics v. 48 , 1-12. *dobretsov , n.l. , buslov , m.m. , vernikovsky , v.a . neoproterosoic to early ordovocian evolution of the paleo-asian ocean : implications to the break-up of rodinia . gondwana research v. 6 , 143-159. *jahn , b. m. , capdevila , r. , liu , d. , vernon , a. , badarch , g. , 2004 . sources of phanerozoic granitoids in           isotopic evidence , and implications for phanerozoic crustal growth . journal of asian earth sciences 23 , 629-653. *krner , a. , windley , b.f. , badarch , g. , tomurtogoo , o. , hegner , e. , jahn , b.m. , gruschka , s. , khain , e.v. , demoux , a. , wingate , m.t.d. , 2007 . accretionary growth and crust-formation in the central asian orogenic belt and comparison with the arabian-nubian shield . geological society of america , memoir 200 , 181209. *kuzmichev , a. b. , bibikova , e. v. , zhuravlev , d. z. , 2001 . neoproterozoic orogeny in the tuva-mongol massif : island arc-continent collision at the northeast rodinia margin , precambrian research 110 , 109-126. *rino , s. , kon , y. , sato , w. , maruyama , s. , santosh , m. , zhao , d. , 2008 . the grenvillian and pan-african orogens : world s largest orogenies through geologic time , and their implications on the origin of superplume . gondwana research 14 , 51-72. *rojas-agramonte , y. , krner ,           wang , w. , donskaya , t , liu , d. , sun , m. , 2011 . detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages from neoproterozoic to palaeozoic arc terranes of mongolia : significance for the origin of crustal fragments in the central asian orogenic belt . gondwana research 19 , 751-763. *safonova , i.yu. , maruyama , s. , hirata , t. , kon , y. , rino s. , 2010 . la icp ms u-pb ages of detrital zircons from russia largest rivers : implications for major granitoid events in eurasia and global episodes of supercontinent formation . journal of geodynamics 50 , 134-153. *sengr , a. m. c. , natalin , b. a. , burtman , v. s. , 1993 . evolution of the altaid tectonic collage and paleozoic crustal growth in eurasia . nature , 364 , 299-307. *windley , b. f. , alexeiev , d. , xiao , w. , krner , a. , badarch , g. , 2007 . tectonic models for accretion of the central asian orogenic belt . journal of the geological society , 164 , 31-47. *xiao w. , huang b. , han           a review of the western part of the altaids : a key to understanding the architecture of accretionary orogens . gondwana research 18 , 253-273.

the caeroesi were a tribe living in belgic gaul when julius caesar s roman forces entered the area in 57 bce . they are know from his account of the   gallic war   . they are generally also equated with the cracates mentioned briefly by tacitus in his   histories   . they were one of a group of tribes listed by his local informants as the   germani   , along with the eburones , condrusi , paemani , and segni . these tribes are referred to as the   germani cisrhenani   , to distinguish them from germani living on the east of the rhine , outside of the gaulish and roman area . whether this meant that they actually spoke a germanic language or not , is still uncertain , but it was claimed by tacitus that these germani were the original germani , and that the term   germani   as it came to be widely used was not           of the original   germani   in his time were the tungri . the general area of the belgian   germani   was between the scheldt and rhine rivers , and north of luxemburg and the moselle , which is where the treverii lived . in modern terms this area includes eastern belgium , the southern parts of the netherlands , and a part of germany on the west of the rhine , but north of koblenz . the caeroesi appear to have lived in the south of this range , in the eifel region , in the area which later because the roman   pagus   of carucum , a sub-division of the treveri . later this became the frankish pagus called caroascus. 180pxthumbboundary marker of the   pagus carucum   . a roman era boundary marker has been found near neidenbach bei kyllburg marked finis pagi carv cvm . this was on the roman road between trier , the main roman city of the treverii , and cologne . this was           to the east of neidenbach , the vinxtbach , a small river flowing eastwards to the rhine , marked the boundary between the roman provinces of germania superior and germania inferior . the name vinxtbach is in fact thought to derive from the latin word   finis   , meaning an end or boundary . today the vinxtbach is still a boundary between modern german dialects , with ripuarian to the north , and moselle frankish to the south . also nearby is the modern boundary of modern german   lnder   of rheinland-pfalz and nordrhein-westfalen . their name is believed to mean sheep people , and to be celtic in origin .
the battle of biberach was fought on 2 october 1796 between a first french republic army led by jean victor marie moreau and a habsburg austrian army led by maximilian anton karl , count baillet de latour . the french army paused in its retreat toward the rhine river to savage the pursuing austrians . the action occurred during the war of the first coalition , part of the french revolutionary wars . biberach an der riss is located 35km mi southwest of ulm . during the summer of 1796 , the two armies of jean-baptiste jourdan in the north and moreau in the south advanced into southern germany . they were opposed by archduke charles , duke of teschen who oversaw two austrian armies under latour and wilhelm von wartensleben . at the battle of amberg on 24 august 1796 , charles and wartensleben combined to throw superior strength against jourdan while moreau was separated from his colleague . after jourdan was beaten again at the battle of wrzburg on 3 september , moreau was forced to abandon southern bavaria to avoid being cut off from france           , moreau lashed out at him at biberach . for a loss of 500 soldiers killed and wounded , moreau s troops inflicted 300 killed and wounded on their enemies and captured 4,000 prisoners , 18 artillery pieces , and two colors . after the engagement , latour followed the french at a more respectful distance . the next action was the battle of emmendingen on 19 october .

the 1988 cotton bowl classic was a college football bowl game played on january 1 , 1988 , at the cotton bowl in dallas , texas , usa . the bowl game featuredthe independent fighting irish of notre dame versus the southwest conference champion aggies of texas a&amp;m . played in front of 73,006 people , texas a&amp;m won the game by a final score of 35-10 . this was the final cotton bowl played without a sponsor for the game .  game summary  an added bonus to the 1988 cotton bowl was notre dames tim brown , a dallas native and the 53rd winner of the heisman trophy . browns presence marked the third time in four seasons the heisman winner would play in the cotton bowl . he also was the irishs seventh heisman winner , but the first ever to play in a bowl game . brown and the irish were the talk of the town , and the excitement led right up to kickoff . the game was barely three minutes old when brown delivered . having returned the opening kickoff 37           when quarterback terry andrysiak hit his all-america receiver with a 17-yard scoring pass . down 7-0 , the aggies countered on scott slaters 26-yard field goal on the final play of the first quarter , but at that point the game belonged clearly to notre dame . the irish took the ensuing kickoff and marched 51 yards for ted gradels 36-yard field goal and a 10-3 advantage . four minutes later , notre dame was on the move again . driving from their own 20 . andrysiak and brown quickly moved the irish back into scoring position . on second down at the a&amp;m 18 , andrysiak dropped back to pass and his target was tight end andy heck . a&amp;ms alex morris read the play and made a leaping interception in the corner of the end zone for what proved to be the key play of the game . the aggies seized the opportunity and stormed through the notre dame defense , needing only six plays to move 80 yards and tie the game . freshman running back darren lewis ended the drive , surprising the irish defense by throwing           got worse for notre dame . on their first play following the a&amp;m score , the irish fumbled the ball back to the aggies . tony jones made the recovery at the notre dame 21 and four plays later , freshman running back larry horton carried two yards for the go-ahead score . a successful two-point conversion pushed the aggies to an 18-10 half- time lead . texas a&amp;m did nt let up in the second half . quarterback bucky richardson , another one of the aggies talented freshmen , scored twice to ice the game , and slater added another field goal . taking a cue from the offense , aggie defenders began to dominate , setting up four of a&amp;ms six scores with turnovers . the a&amp;m wrecking crew , composed of linebackers adam bob , aaron wallace , dana batiste , and john roper , and noseguard sammy obrient , smothered the notre dame attack . after catching six passes for 105 yards in the games first 22 minutes , brown was shut down completely and did not make another reception following morris key interception . in the           unsportsmanlike conduct.it was a decisive victory for a&amp;m , 35-10.

following is a sampling of some of nasa s past and present programs excluding manned spacecraft . the years in brackets are for first and latest launching . a program is a number of flights or missions with the same kind of satellite , therefore the name of the program and the name of the satellite used will often be the same . in all nasa have made more than 1,000 unmanned missions into earth orbit or beyond .  list of programs   explorer program  the explorer program continues and over more than five decades has launched 90+ missions into space . it has matured into one of nasa s lower-cost mission programs , relative to its other programs . it began as a u.s. army proposal to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the international geophysical year ; however , that proposal was rejected in favor of the u.s. navy s project vanguard . the explorer program was later reestablished to catch up with the soviet union after that nation s launch of sputnik 1 on october           1958 ; at this time the project still belonged to abma and jpl . besides being the first u.s. satellite , it is known for discovering the van allen radiation belt . the explorer program was transferred to nasa , which continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions , typically an artificial satellite with a science focus . over the years , nasa has launched a series of explorer spacecraft carrying a wide variety of scientific investigations .  pioneer program  the pioneer program is a series of nasa unmanned space missions that was designed for planetary exploration . there were a number of such missions in the program , but the most notable were pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 , which explored the outer planets and left the solar system . both carry a golden plaque , depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes , should any extraterrestrials find them someday . additionally , the pioneer mission to venus consisted of two components , launched separately . pioneer venus           studied the planet for more than a decade after orbital insertion in 1978 . pioneer venus 2 or pioneer venus multiprobe sent four small probes into the venusian atmosphere .  echo project  project echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment . each spacecraft was a metalized balloon satellite to be inflated in space and acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals . communication signals were bounced off of them from one-point on earth to another . nasa s echo 1 satellite was built by gilmore schjeldahl company in northfield , minnesota . following the failure of the delta rocket carrying echo 1 on may 13 , 1960 , echo 1a was put successfully into a 944 to 1,048 mi orbit by another thor-delta and a microwave transmission from the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california was received at bell laboratories in homdel , new jersey on august 12 , 1960 . echo 2 was a 41.1-meter diameter metalized pet film balloon , which was the last balloon satellite launched by project echo . it used an improved inflation system           was launched january 25 , 1964 on a thor agena rocket .  ranger program  the ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the united states in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the moon . the ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface , returning those images until they were destroyed upon impact . a series of mishaps , however , led to the failure of the first six flights . at one point , the program was called shoot and hope . congress launched an investigation into problems of management at nasa headquarters and jet propulsion laboratory . after reorganizing the organization twice , ranger 7 successfully returned images in july 1964 , followed by two more successful missions . ranger was originally designed , beginning in 1959 , in three distinct phases , called blocks . each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design . the jpl mission designers planned multiple launches in each block , to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value           flight . total research , development , launch , and support costs for the ranger series of spacecraft was approximately $170 million .  telstar  telstar was not a nasa program but a commercial communication satellite project . nasa s contribution to it was limited to launch services , as well as tracking and telemetry duties . the first two telstar satellites were experimental and nearly identical . telstar 1 was launched on top of a thor-delta rocket on july 10 , 1962 . it successfully relayed through space the first television pictures , telephone calls , fax images and provided the first live transatlantic television feed . telstar 2 was launched may 7 , 1963 . bell telephone laboratories designed and built the telstar satellite . they were prototypes intended to prove various concepts behind the large constellation of orbiting satellites . the faceted 171 lb sphere had a diameter of a little more than 34 inches . bell telephone laboratories also developed much of           solar cells , and traveling wave tube amplifiers . to handle telstar communications , at&amp;t built ground stations at andover , maine ; pleumeur-bodou , france ; and goonhilly downs , britain . these were similar to , but larger than , the ground station used for project echo . telstar was a technical success . a us . information agency poll showed that telstar was better known in great britain than sputnik had been in 1957 . in contrast to sputnik , telstar s signals were useful .  mariner program  the mariner program conducted by nasa launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate mars , venus and mercury . the program included a number of firsts , including the first planetary flyby , the first pictures from another planet , the first planetary orbiter , and the first gravity assist maneuver . of the ten vehicles in the mariner series , seven were successful and three were lost . the planned mariner 11 and mariner 12 vehicles evolved into voyager 1 and voyager 2 of the voyager program ,           enlarged versions of the mariner 9 spacecraft . other mariner-based spacecraft , launched since voyager , included the magellan probe to venus , and the galileo probe to jupiter . a second-generation mariner spacecraft , called the mariner mark ii series , eventually evolved into the cassinihuygens probe , now in orbit around saturn . all mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal bus , which housed all of the electronics , and to which all components were attached , such as antennae , cameras , propulsion , and power sources . all probes except mariner 1 , mariner 2 and mariner 5 had tv cameras . the first five mariners were launched on atlas-agena rockets , while the last five used the atlas-centaur . all mariner-based probes after mariner 10 used the titan iiie , titan iv unmanned rockets or the space shuttle with a solid-fueled inertial upper stage and multiple planetary flybys.  surveyor program  the surveyor program was a nasa program that , from 1966 through 1968 , sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the moon . its primary goal           moon . the mission called for the craft to travel directly to the moon on an impact trajectory , on a journey that lasted 63 to 65 hours , and ended with a deceleration of just over three minutes to a soft-landing . the program was implemented by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory to prepare for the apollo program . the total cost of the surveyor program was officially $469 million . five of the surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the moon , including the first one . two failed : surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a failed mid-course correction , and surveyor 4 was lost for contact 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down . all seven spacecraft are still on the moon ; none of the missions included returning them to earth . some parts of surveyor 3 were returned to earth by the crew of apollo 12 , which landed near it in 1969 . the camera from this craft is on display at the national air and space museum in washington , dc.            helios ii space probes , also known as helios-a and helios-b , were a pair of probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes . a joint venture of the federal republic of germany and nasa , the probes were launched from cape canaveral air force station , florida , on dec 10 , 1974 , and jan 15 , 1976 , respectively . the probes are notable for setting a maximum speed record among spacecraft at /h . the helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s , but they continued to send data up to 1985 . the probes are no longer functional but still remain in their elliptical orbit around the sun .  viking program  the viking program consisted of a pair of space probes sent to marsviking 1 and viking 2 . each vehicle was composed of two main parts , an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of mars from orbit , and a lander designed to study the           communication relays for the landers once they touched down . viking 1 was launched on august 20 , 1975 , and the second craft , viking 2 , was launched on september 9 , 1975 , both riding atop titan iii-e rockets with centaur upper stages . by discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water , the viking program caused a revolution in scientific ideas about water on mars . the primary objectives of the viking orbiters were to transport the landers to mars , perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites , act as a communications relays for the landers , and to perform their own scientific investigations . the orbiter , based on the earlier mariner 9 spacecraft , was an octagon approximately 2.5m ft across . the total launch mass was , of which were propellant and attitude control gas .  voyager program  the voyager program is a series of nasa unmanned space missions that consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes , voyager 1 and voyager 2 . they were launched in 1977 to           1970s . although they were officially designated to study just jupiter and saturn , the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system . both probes have achieved escape velocity from the solar system and will never return . both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system , of which little was previously known . , voyager 1 was at a distance of 115.251 au , traveling away from both the earth and the sun at a speed of /s , which corresponds to a greater specific orbital energy than any other probe .  high energy astronomy observatory 1  the first of nasa s three high energy astronomy observatories , heao 1 , launched august 12 , 1977 aboard an atlas rocket with a centaur upper stage , operated until january 9 , 1979 . during that time , it scanned the x-ray sky almost three times over 0.2 kev 10 mev , provided nearly constant monitoring of x-ray sources near the ecliptic           number of objects through pointed observations . heao included four large x-ray and gamma-ray astronomy instruments , known as a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 , respectively . the orbital inclination was about 22.7 degrees . heao 1 re-entered the earth s atmosphere on march 15 , 1979.  solar maximum mission  the solar maximum mission satellite was designed to investigate solar phenomenon , particularly solar flares . it was launched on february 14 , 1980 . although not unique in this endeavor , the smm was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a manned space mission . during sts-41-c in 1984 , the space shuttle challenger intercepted the smm , maneuvering it into the shuttle s payload bay for maintenance and repairs . smm had been fitted with a shuttle grapple fixture so that the shuttle s robot arm could grab it for repair . the mission was depicted in the 1985 imax movie the dream           2 , 1989 , when the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up .  infrared astronomical satellite , iras  the infrared astronomical satellite was the first-ever space-based observatory to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths . it discovered about 350,000 sources , many of which are still awaiting identification . new discoveries included a dust disk around vega and the first images of the milky way galaxy s core . iras s life , like that of most of infrared satellites that followed after , was limited by its cooling system . to effectively work in the infrared domain , the telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures . in iras s case , 73 kilograms of superfluid helium kept the telescope at a temperature of 2 kelvins by evaporation . the supply of liquid helium was depleted after 10 months on november 22 , 1983 , causing the telescope temperature to rise and preventing further observations . the spacecraft continues to orbit close to the earth . the telescope was a joint project           , and the united kingdom . over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 micrometer wavelengths.  magellan probe  the magellan spacecraft was a space probe sent to the planet venus , the first unmanned interplanetary spacecraft to be launched by nasa since its successful pioneer orbiter , also to venus , in 1978 . it was also the first of three deep-space probes to be launched on the space shuttle , and the first spacecraft to employ aerobraking techniques to lower its orbit . magellan created the first high resolution mapping of the planet s surface features . prior venus missions had created low resolution radar globes of general , continent-sized formations . magellan , performed detailed imaging and analysis of craters , hills , ridges , and other geologic formations , to a degree comparable to the visible-light photographic mapping of other planets .  galileo probe  galileo was an unmanned spacecraft sent by nasa to study the planet jupiter and its           by the space shuttle atlantis on the sts-34 mission . it arrived at jupiter on december 7 , 1995 , a little more than six years later , via gravitational assist flybys of venus and earth . despite antenna problems , galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby , discovered the first asteroid moon , was the first spacecraft to orbit jupiter , and launched the first probe into jupiter s atmosphere . galileo s prime mission was a two-year study of the jovian system . the spacecraft traveled around jupiter in elongated ellipses , each orbit lasting about two months . the differing distances from jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed galileo to sample different parts of the planet s extensive magnetosphere . the orbits were designed for close up flybys of jupiter s largest moons . once galileo s prime mission was concluded , an extended mission followed starting on december 7 , 1997 ; the spacecraft made a number of daring close flybys of jupiter s moons europa and io . the closest approach was on october 15 , 2001 . on september 21 ,           of service in the jovian system , galileo s mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into jupiter s atmosphere at a speed of nearly 50 kilometers per second . the program s funding was running out and the spacecraft was low on propellant ; in addition , many systems were damaged . one of the reasons given for its destruction was to avoid the chance of it contaminating local moons with bacteria from earth . of particular interest was the ice-crusted moon europa , which , thanks to galileo , scientists now suspect harbors a salt water ocean beneath its surface .  hubble space telescope  the hubble space telescope is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a space shuttle in april 1990 . it is named after american astronomer edwin hubble . although not the first space telescope , hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy . the hst is a collaboration between nasa and           s great observatories , along with the compton gamma ray observatory , the chandra x-ray observatory , and the spitzer space telescope . the hst s success has paved the way for greater collaboration between the agencies . the hst was created with a relatively small budget of $2 billion and has continued operation since 1990 , delighting both scientists and the public . some of its images , such as the groundbreaking hubble deep field , have become famous .  ulysses  ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe that was designed to study the sun as a joint venture of nasa and the european space agency . due to the loss of challenger , the launch of ulysses was delayed until october 6 , 1990 aboard   discovery   . the spacecraft s mission was to study the sun at all latitudes . to do this required a major orbital plane shift . due to velocity change limitations of the shuttle and the inertial upper stage , this was accomplished by using an           an engine burn . the need for a jupiter encounter meant that ulysses could not be powered by solar cells and was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator instead . by february 2008 , the power output from the rtg , which is generated by heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 , had decreased enough to leave insufficient power for internal heaters to keep the spacecraft s attitude control hydrazine fuel from freezing . the end of mission was at one-point scheduled for july 1 , 2008 , but mission scientists came up with a method to keep the fuel liquid by conducting a short thruster burn every two hours , allowing the mission to continue . the cessation of mission operations and deactivation or hibernation of the spacecraft was determined by the inability to prevent attitude control fuel from freezing . the last day for mission operations on ulysses was june 30 , 2009.  upper atmosphere research satellite , uars  uars is a science satellite used from 1991 to 2005 to study earth s atmosphere , including the ozone layer .           durable , allowing extended observation from its instrument suite . it was launched aboard space shuttle discovery and deployed into space from the payload bay with its robotic arm , under guidance from the crew . the satellite was expected to undergo atmospheric re-entry in the late evening of friday september 23 , 2011 or early morning of saturday september 24 , 2011 , eastern daylight time . on 24 september 2011 1:09 am edt uars made its re-entry . at around about 6 tonnes , it was the heaviest nasa satellite to undergo uncontrolled atmospheric entry since skylab in the summer 1979 , which was roughly 70 tonnes . it is heavier than pegasus 2 , which fell back in fall of 1979 , but weighed less than 2 tonnes .  discovery program  nasa s discovery program is a series of lower-cost , highly-focused american scientific space missions that are exploring the solar system . it was founded in 1992 to implement then-nasa administrator daniel s. goldin s vision of faster ,           traditional nasa missions where targets and objectives are pre-specified . instead , these cost-capped missions are proposed and led by a scientist called the principal investigator . proposing teams may include people from industry , small businesses , government laboratories , and universities . proposals are selected through a competitive peer review process . all of the completed discovery missions are accomplishing ground-breaking science and adding significantly to the body of knowledge about the solar system . nasa also accepts proposals for competitively selected discovery program missions of opportunity . this provides opportunities to participate in non-nasa missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of a science instrument or to re-purpose an existing nasa spacecraft . these opportunities are currently offered through nasa s stand alone mission of opportunity program . examples of missions are mars pathfinder , kepler , stardust , genesis and deep impact . the mars pathfinder later renamed the carl sagan memorial station , was launched on december 4 , 1996 , just a month after the mars global surveyor was launched . on board           execute many experiments on the martian surface . it was the second project from nasa s discovery program , which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto cheaper , faster and better promoted by the then administrator , daniel goldin . the mission was directed by the jet propulsion laboratory , a division of the california institute of technology , responsible for nasa s mars exploration program . kepler is a space observatory launched by nasa to discover earth-like planets orbiting other stars . the spacecraft , named in honor of the 17th-century german astronomer johannes kepler , was launched in march 2009 . stardust is a 300-kilogram robotic space probe launched by nasa on february 7 , 1999 to study the asteroid 5535 annefrank and collect samples from the coma of comet wild 2 . the primary mission was completed january 15 , 2006 , when the sample return capsule returned to earth . operating for , stardust intercepted comet tempel 1 on february 15 , 2011 , a small solar system body previously visited by deep impact on july 4 , 2005 . it           and return the sample to earth and the first to acquire images of a previously visited comet . the genesis spacecraft was a nasa sample return probe which collected a sample of solar wind and returned it to earth for analysis . it was the first nasa sample return mission to return material since the apollo program , and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the moon . genesis was launched on august 8 , 2001 , and crash-landed in utah on september 8 , 2004 , after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute . the crash contaminated many of the sample collectors , but although most were damaged , many of the collectors were successfully recovered . deep impact is a nasa space probe launched on january 12 , 2005 . it was designed to study the composition of the comet interior of 9p/tempel , by releasing an impactor into the comet . at 5:52 utc on july 4 , 2005 , the impactor successfully collided with the comet s nucleus . the impact excavated debris from the interior of the nucleus           showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected .  clementine  clementine was a joint space project between the ballistic missile defense organization and nasa . launched on january 25 , 1994 , the objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the moon and the near-earth asteroid 1620 geographos . the geographos observations were not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft .  mars global surveyor  the mars global surveyor was developed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory and launched november 1996 . it began the united states  return to mars after a 10-year absence . it completed its primary mission in january 2001 and was in its third extended mission phase when , on november 2 , 2006 , the spacecraft failed to respond to commands . in           spacecraft used a series of high-resolution cameras to explore the surface of mars during its mission , returning more than 240,000 images spanning portions of 4.8 martian years , from september 1997 to november 2006 . the surveyor s cameras utilized 3 instruments : a narrow angle camera that took high resolution images red and blue wide angle pictures for context and daily global imaging .  cassinihuygens  cassinihuygens is a joint nasa/esa/asi spacecraft mission studying the planet saturn and its many natural satellites . it includes a saturn orbiter and an atmospheric probe/lander for the moon titan , although it has also returned data on a wide variety of other things including the heliosphere , jupiter , and relativity tests . the titan probe ,   huygens   , entered and landed on titan in 2005 .   cassini   is the fourth space probe to visit saturn and the first to enter orbit , with its mission ongoing as           on a titan ivb/centaur and entered into orbit around saturn on july 1 , 2004 , after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of earth , venus , and jupiter . on december 25 , 2004 ,   huygens   separated from the orbiter at approximately 02:00 utc . it reached saturn s moon titan on january 14 , 2005 , when it entered titan s atmosphere and descended downward to the surface . it successfully returned data to earth , using the orbiter as a relay . this was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer solar system . sixteen european countries and the united states make up the team responsible for designing , building , flying and collecting data from the cassini orbiter and huygens probe . the mission is managed by nasas jet propulsion laboratory in the united states , where the orbiter was assembled . huygens was developed by the european space research and technology centre , whose prime contractor was alcatel of france . equipment and instruments for the probe were supplied by many countries .  new millennium program           project with focus on engineering validation of new technologies for space applications . funding for the program was eliminated from the fy2009 budget by the 110th united states congress , effectively leading to its cancellation . the spacecraft in the new millennium program were originally named deep space and earth observing . with a refocussing of the program in 2000 , the deep space series was renamed space technology . deep space 1 is a spacecraft dedicated to testing a payload of advanced , high risk technologies . launched on october 24 , 1998 , the deep space mission carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 braille , which was selected as the mission s science target . its mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet borrelly and further engineering testing . problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration . while the flyby of the asteroid was a partial success , the encounter with the comet           had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue . the deep space series was continued by the deep space 2 probes , which were launched in january 1999 on mars polar lander and were intended to strike the surface of mars . deep space 1 was the first spacecraft to use ion powered rocketry , in contrast to the traditional chemical powered rockets .  gravity recovery and climate experiment  the gravity recovery and climate experiment , a joint mission of nasa and the german aerospace center , has been making detailed measurements of earth s gravity field since its launch in march 2002 . the satellites were launched from plesetsk cosmodrome , russia on a rockot launch vehicle . by measuring gravity , grace shows how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time . data from the grace satellites is an important tool for studying earth s ocean , geology , and climate . grace is a collaborative endeavor involving the           austin ; nasa s jet propulsion laboratory , pasadena , calif. ; the german space agency and germany s national research center for geosciences , potsdam . the jet propulsion laboratory is responsible for the overall mission management under the nasa essp program . the principal investigator is dr. byron tapley of the university of texas center for space research , and the co-principal investigator is dr. christoph reigber of the geoforschungszentrum potsdam .  earth observing system  the earth observing system is a program of nasa comprising a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in earth orbit designed for long-term global observations of the land surface , biosphere , atmosphere , and oceans of the earth . the satellite component of the program was launched in 1997 . the program is centerpiece of nasa s earth science enterprise . mission examples are : seawifs , landsat 7 , quikscat , jason 1 , grace , aqua ,           mars exploration rovers  nasa s mars exploration rover mission , is an ongoing robotic space mission involving two rovers exploring the planet mars . the mission is managed for nasa by the jet propulsion laboratory , which designed , built and is operating the rovers . the mission began in 2003 with the sending of the two roversmer-a spirit and mer-b opportunityto explore the martian surface and geology . the mission s scientific objective is to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on mars . the mission is part of nasa s mars exploration program which includes three previous successful landers : the two viking program landers in 1976 and mars pathfinder probe in 1997 . the total cost of building , launching , landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-martian-day primary mission was us$820 million . since the rovers continued to function far beyond their initial 90 sol primary mission  messenger is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet mercury , the first spacecraft ever to do so . the 485 kg spacecraft was launched aboard a delta ii rocket in august 2004 to study mercury s chemical composition , geology , and magnetic field . messenger became the second mission after mariner 10 to reach mercury when it made a flyby in january 2008 , followed by a second flyby in october 2008 , and a third flyby in september 2009 . then messenger entered orbit around mercury on march 18 , 2011 . the instruments carried by messenger were used on that complex series of flybys the spacecraft flew by earth once , venus twice , and mercury itself three times , allowing it to decelerate relative to mercury using minimal fuel . when messenger entered orbit around mercury on march 18 , 2011 , it then reactivated its science instruments on march 24 , returning the first photo from mercury orbit on march 29.  new frontiers           a series of space exploration missions being conducted by nasa with the purpose of researching several of the sun s planets including jupiter , venus , and the dwarf planet pluto . nasa is encouraging both domestic and international scientists to submit mission proposals for the project . new frontiers was built on the innovative approach used by the discovery and explorer programs of principal investigator-led missions . it is designed for medium-class missions that can not be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of discovery , but are not as large as flagship-class missions . there are currently two new frontiers missions in progress , new horizons which launched on january 19 , 2006 , and juno which launched on august 5 , 2011 ; a third new frontiers mission , osiris-rex , has been selected for launch in 2016.  mars scout program  the mars scout program was a nasa initiative to send a series of small , low-cost robotic missions to mars , competitively selected from innovative proposals by the scientific community . the program had an array of missions destined to reach           each scout project was to cost less than us$485 million . the phoenix lander and maven orbiter were selected and developed before the program was retired in 2010 . phoenix was a lander originally intended for the canceled mars surveyor mission but adapted to the new mission . phoenix was launched on august 4 , 2007 , and landed in the icy northern polar region of the planet on may 25 , 2008 . phoenix was designed to search for environments suitable for microbial life on mars , and to research the history of water there . the 90-day primary mission was successful and the overall mission was concluded on november 10 , 2008 , after engineers were unable to contact the craft . the lander last made a brief communication with earth on november 2 , 2008.  dawn  dawn is a nasa spacecraft tasked with the exploration and study of the asteroid vesta and the dwarf planet ceres , the two largest members of the asteroid belt . the spacecraft was constructed with some european cooperation , with components contributed by partners in germany ,             mission is managed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory .   dawn   will be the first spacecraft to visit either vesta or ceres . it may furthermore be the first spacecraft to orbit two separate extraterrestrial bodies , using ion thrusters to travel between its targets . previous multi-target missions using conventional drives , such as the   voyager   program , were restricted to flybys . launched on september 27 , 2007 ,   dawn   entered orbit around vesta on july 16 , 2011 , and will explore it until august 26 , 2012 . thereafter , the spacecraft will head to ceres , which it is scheduled to reach in february 2015 .   dawn   is nasas first purely exploratory mission to use ion propulsion.  lunar reconnaissance orbiter  the lunar reconnaissance orbiter is a nasa robotic spacecraft currently orbiting the moon on a low polar mapping orbit . the lro mission is a precursor to future manned missions to the moon by nasa . to this end a           potential resources on the moon , characterize the radiation environment , and demonstrate new technology . the probe will make a 3-d map of the moon s surface and has provided some of the first images of apollo equipment left on the moon . the first images from lro were published on july 2 , 2009 , showing a region in the lunar highlands south of mare nubium . launched on june 18 , 2009 , in conjunction with the lunar crater observation and sensing satellite , as the vanguard of nasa s lunar precursor robotic program , this is the first united states mission to the moon in over ten years . lro and lcross are the first

igreja da madalena is a church in portugal . it is classified as a national monument .  history  the magdalene church that currently exists is the result of several reconstructions . the original structure was erected in 1150 or 1164 , by order of d. afonso henriques . in 1363 , a fire completely destroyed the church , and ferdinand i of portugal had it rebuilt . in 1600 the church was partially destroyed by a cyclone . in 1755 the church was demolished by the 1755 lisbon earthquake . in 1783 queen maria i of portugal had to rebuild the church again . in 1833 , the church underwent some changes .
walter carroll was a professional composer and teacher . he was born in strangeways , manchester , and received his bachelor s degree in music at durham university . carroll returned to manchester to earn another bachelor s degree and the first mus.d. ever conferred in manchester . in 1893 he became a lecturer in harmony at the newly formed royal manchester college of music and held chairs at the college of harmony and composition , and of the art of teaching . carroll started a training course for music teachers in 1907 and was appointed music adviser by the manchester education committee in 1918 . he gave up all his other work in 1920 to concentrate on music for children . carroll regularly visited and advised teachers in about four hundred schools , lecturing on the teaching of singing , instrumental music , and music appreciation . he composed many piano pieces for children , published as collections with titles inspired by nature , such as  the countryside  ,  sea idylls  ,  forest           by , these miniatures are still popular , one of them , alone at sunset , is included in the associated board of the royal schools of music 20112012 grade 4 examination . more than his own compositions , he is perhaps best remembered for his compilation for young piano students of short keyboard pieces by j.s. bach ,   first lessons in bach for the piano   . carroll retired in 1934 and died at his home in didsbury in 1955 at the age of 86.  references 
precededby =   son of god   is an award-winning british documentary series that chronicles the life of jesus christ using scientific and contemporary historical evidence . it was presented by jeremy bowen , and its first episode premiered in the united kingdom on 1 april 2001 . the executive producer was ruth pitt and it was directed by jean-claude bragardit took a total of 16 months to produce and cost . a full symphonic score was composed by james whitbourn .   son of god   featured interviews with 21 historians and other biblical experts , live action reenactments of the life of jesus with leron livo in the lead role , and computer-generated images of what locations from jesus s time might have looked like . these images , created by design team red vision , were praised by critics and received an outstanding achievement award at the 2001 royal television society north awards .   son           three episodes , each of which focused on a different stage of jesus s life . the first episode , the real man , looked at the historical evidence for the existence of jesus , and documented his life from his birth to his temptation . episode two , the mission , discussed how jesus became popular among jews and greeks , and why the pharisees of the area might have seen him as a threat . the final hours , the third and final episode of   son of god   , looked at jesus s crucifixion , and presented some ideas as to how the traditional views of the crucifixion may conflict with how it really occurred . the episode concluded with the construction of a computer-generated animation of how jesus may have appeared . critical reaction to the series was mixed . while some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality , others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents . the reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned .           the uk on bbc one during april 2001 , where it received a viewership of six million and an audience share of 25% . in the united states , the series was shown on the discovery channel under the name   jesus : the complete story   as a single three-hour programme , two weeks after its uk broadcast . the show was also licensed to countries including france , denmark and new zealand .  production    son of god   was devised in 1999 , and was produced and joint-sponsored by bbc manchester and the discovery channel in association with france 3 and jerusalem productions . the show was directed by jean-claude bragardwhose previous bbc work had included   kicking &amp; screaming a history of football   and the documentary series   panorama   and the executive producer was ruth pitt , who had worked on documentaries such as   42 up   and channel 4 s   the state of marriage   . during its promotion , pitt described   son of god            ever been done . jeremy bowen , a former middle east correspondent for bbc news , was chosen to present the programme for its uk broadcast . british conductor james whitbourn was commissioned to write a complete symphonic score for the series , which was performed by the bbc philharmonic . the completed programme featured more than an hour and a half of whitbourn s music . whitbourn subsequently used the seminal themes from his orchestral score as the basis of his popular choral work ,   son of god mass   , for soprano saxophone , choir and organ . computer graphic images were created by design group red vision , who employed techniques similar to ones used in the 2000 bbc series   walking with dinosaurs   . speaking in september 2001 , a spokesman for red vision stated that their involvement in   son of god   had been incredibly successful for them . promotional campaigns for both the british and american broadcasts of the series focused on the technology and science being used in the programme , and the special effects           facial reconstruction during the final episode showing what jesus might have looked like garnered significant media attention . in the lead-up to episode one , several newspapers , including   the daily mail   and   the guardian   , ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of jesus . british television listings magazine   radio times   featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 march issue under the headline is this the face of jesus ? . this cover and its headline received criticism from some commentators for being sensationalist and misleading .  episodes    son of god   consists of a single series of three episodes . each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of jesus s life . the episodes take the format of bowen visiting significant locations from the life of jesus , talking head interviews with 21 historians and biblical experts , and reenactments of jesus s life featuring israeli actor liron levo . locations from jesus s timesuch as caesarea , yatta and           plans , and were then digitised into computer graphics by red vision .  the real man  the first episode of   son of god   , the real man , documents jesus s life up to his temptation , and details the historical evidence for his existence . bowen visits jerusalem , where he calls jesus s death one of the best attested facts in ancient history . **33;50392;ref he cites the romano-jewish historian josephus as one of 80 sources that confirms that jesus existed and that describes him as a wise man who did surprising feats , .. won over followers from among jews and greeks , .. was accused by the jewish leaders , and was condemned to be crucified by pilate . bowen interviews james h. charlesworth from princeton university about the discovery of the dead sea scrolls in 1947 , then travels to bethlehem to visit the church of the nativity , a structure built over a series of first-century caves and grottos . while there , he speculates that jesus may have been born in a cave rather than an inn ,           from the hebrew university of jerusalem confirms this , saying that the greek word katalyma is usually translated into english as upper room rather than inn . **34;50427;ref the real man also looks at the story of the star of bethlehem , which bowen states would have been an astrological rather than astronomical phenomenon . according to astronomer michael molner , astrologers from around the time of herod the great would have believed that the constellation aries symbolised his kingdom and the lands that he controlled during 6 bc , the year that some scholars theorise that jesus was born , a rare planetary alignment meant that jupiter , saturn , the sun and the moon would have all appeared in this constellation . **34;50463;ref bowen next looks at how jesus would have been born out of wedlock : mark goodacre , a historian from the university of birmingham , asserts that jewish , pagan and christian sources all confirm that jesus was born out of wedlock , as do both the gospels of matthew and luke . all four canonical gospels agree that the city of nazareth was where jesus           university , proposes that jesus s interest in religion and politics might have been sparked off during a family visit to the temple mount , the headquarters of the jewish faith . **34;50499;ref the episode ends with bowen spending the night alone at the mount of temptation just above jericho , where jesus is traditionally believed to have spent 40 days and nights being tempted by the devil .  the mission  episode two , the mission , discusses how jesus became popular and why the pharisees might have seen him as a potential threat . bowen visits the dome of the rock , the site of jerusalem s temple , and discusses how jesus went to the sea of galilee to recruit his disciples . he speaks with orna cohen , a conservator of antiquities who led the excavation of the sea of galilee boat , who suggests that the boat may have been similar to one owned by saint peter . bowen then travels to capernaum and visits the house of peter , where he speaks to mordechai aviam , an archaeologist from the israel antiquities authority .           that the house belonged to peter . bowen visits the tomb of a first-century scholar and miracle-worker named hanina ben dosa , and contrasts hanina s life with that of jesus s : for example , while jesus was executed , hanina was not . **32;50535;ref the mission then looks at how jesus may have been viewed by the religious leaders of the time . the canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of jesus healing or performing exorcisms , and making the unclean clean again . **33;50569;ref jesus told lepers to go up to the temple mount , where they were usually excluded , and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels . jesus met and ate with sinners , the disabled and prostitutes , and fulfilled old testament prophecy by riding into the temple mount through the golden gate on a donkey at passover . bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening . **33;50604;ref  the final hours  the final hours , the third episode of   son           alive . bowen claims that the last supper would have been held in the guest room of a well-to-do house in jerusalem . **36;50639;ref writings by josephus suggest that the last supper took place in a triclinium . as guest of honour , jesus would have been at the end of the table with john the apostle at his side , rather than at the centre , as proposed by more familiar depictions such as leonardo da vinci s   the last supper   . bowen then looks at whether or not jesus could have sweated blood at gethsemane . leaving the middle east for the first time , he travels to new york city and meets with frederick zugibe , a forensic pathologist at columbia university . zugibe states that jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis , a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die . he also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences . zugibe experiments on volunteers in rutland county , vermont , by measuring their blood pressure while           level with their shoulders . he concludes that the traditional view of jesus s crucifixion , with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists , may have been possible if his feet were supported . the 1968 discovery of the skeleton of jehohanan , a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion , also supports this theory . **37;50677;ref next , bowen questions whether the disciple judas iscariot truly did double-cross jesus . william klassen , an historian at cole biblique in jerusalem , theorises that the greek word paradidomi was mistranslated , and that judas simply handed over jesus to the romans , rather than betrayed him . **37;50716;ref the final hours ends with a facial reconstruction suggesting what jesus may have looked like . using one of three first-century jewish skulls from a forensic science department in israel , a clay model is created through forensic anthropology by richard neave , a retired medical artist from the unit of art in medicine at manchester university . the graphics created by red vision were well received :   the daily record            mclean of   the guardian   noted that the series was visually , .. quite a treat . mclean also commented that the programme itself was rather interesting , but that it contained slightly odd , slightly irrelevant diversions . a review of a more critical nature came from catherine bennett , also writing for   the guardian   , who questioned the facial reconstruction from the third episode and suggested that it was dismissive to imply that it was how jesus truly appeared . speaking about the study , bennett remarked : we must hope that .. future bbc controllers do not dig up , say , robin cook s skull , drape it in plasticine , and ask :  is this the real face of tony blair ? . john preston , writing for   the sunday telegraph   , also questioned the reliability of the reconstruction , and branded the series as dumbed down . the programme received criticism from theological scholars : following the broadcast of the first episode , tom wright , one of two consultants used during production           been misrepresented by the show . wright claimed that the bbc had elected to portray jesus simply as a politically correct social worker . father heinrich pfeiffer , a german professor of iconography at the pontifical gregorian university , similarly felt that the computer-generated face conflicted with the ones seen in the shroud of turin and the manoppello image . reviews of the american broadcast of   jesus : the complete story   were also mixed . while some reviewers described the show as fascinating and reverent , during its american broadcast on the discovery channel , the series was watched by 12 million . it was repeated in the us during march the following year , and gained a figure of 1.5 million viewers per episode . the series was nominated for two awards , both for the computer-generated images created by graphics team red vision : it was first nominated at the 2001 leaf awards , then won an

westwood is a big village and a civil parish in wiltshire , england .  location  the village is located southwest of bradford on avon , with avoncliff railway station , kennet &amp; avon canal and river avon setting the northern boundary for the village . the neighbouring villages are winsley and turleigh from north , and freshford and sharpstone from west .  history  westwood s recorded history begins in 983 ad , when king ethelred s charters granted various pieces of land to his servant aelfnoth , and four years later to his huntsman leofwine . in norman times , westwood was one of the estates assigned for the support of the monks at winchester priory . the residents of the manor continued to be tenants of the priory until it was dissolved by henry viii . the medieval population of westwood , as recorded in domesday book of 1086 , consisted of just 13 households , growing to 45 recorded taxpayers in the late 14th century . the earliest part of the present parish church of st mary dates from the 13th century           perpendicular gothic nave , chapel and tower were added in the late 15th century . the earliest records of a substantial quarrying industry at westwood date from 1649 . by the mid-19th century , the quality of westwood stone had earned a good reputation , and over the next half-century , output increased at a great rate . westwood stone went to build many houses in bath , as well as holy trinity church in trowbridge . a narrow-gauge railway was constructed to transport the huge blocks of rough cut stone from the quarry to the cutting-yard at avoncliff railway station . nowadays , all that remains from the centuries of intensive quarrying is the labyrinth of tunnels , eight feet high and twelve feet wide . they have been put to a number of imaginative uses , especially after they were taken over by the ministry of supply in 1939 . for example , the eastern part of the quarry tunnels had since 1928 been used for growing mushrooms , as the relatively stable ambient temperatures and the high humidity of the underground were found perfectly suitable           equipment at an underground factory which had been located in the tunnels to defend against luftwaffe raids . additionally , by the end of 1942 the westwood tunnels had probably housed the greatest and most valuable collection of cultural and artistic artifacts assembled in one location anywhere in the world , including exhibits from british museum , pictures from the national portrait gallery , tapestries from the victoria and albert museum , the elgin marbles , and the wright brothers  aeroplane . a special air conditioning plant had to be installed to control the humidity underground .

the stanford rugby teams of 1906 to 1917 represented stanford university as the school s only football program during those years , replacing american football with rugby union . the school had played american football from 1892 to 1905 , but in 1906 , concerned with the growing levels of violence in football , stanford and other universities changed to rugby . stanford played twelve seasons of rugby , during which it played other college teams , club teams from the united states , canada , and australia , as well as the new zealand national team and australia national team . despite the team s success , it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers , and after rival california returned to football in 1915 , stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents ; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to world war i , the school returned to american football in 1919.  switch to rugby  american football in the early 1900s had become increasingly violent ; with no forward pass , the ball carrier           his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries . in 1905 , 18 deaths , three at the college level , were attributed to football ; 159 serious injuries were also reported , 88 at the college level . reform was demanded by such voices as u.s. president theodore roosevelt , who decried the brutality and foul play of the game , and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue . as a result , before the next season began , new rules were put in place to discourage such play . the forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations . despite the planned changes , a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year , including columbia , nyu , and northwestern . several universities on the west coast , led by california and stanford , replaced the sport with rugby . at the time , the future of football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide . other schools that           santa clara , and usc . however , due to the perception that west coast football was inferior to the game played on the east coast anyway , east coast and midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football . with no nationwide movement , the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small . the schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in australia , new zealand , and especially , due to its proximity , canada . the annual big game between stanford and california continued as rugby , with the winner invited by the british columbia rugby union to a tournament in vancouver over the christmas holidays , with the winner of that tournament receiving the cooper keith trophy .  return to football  in 12 seasons of rugby , stanford was remarkably successful : the team had three undefeated seasons , three one-loss seasons , and an overall record of 94 wins , 20 losses , and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816 . however , after a           of its newly adopted sport , which was not spreading as many had hoped . students and alumni began to clamor for a return to football to allow wider intercollegiate competition . the pressure at rival california was stronger , and in 1915 california returned to football . as reasons for the change , the school cited football rule changes , the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play football , interest in playing other east coast and midwest schools , and a patriotic desire to play an american game . california s return to football increased the pressure on stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry . stanford played its 1915 , 1916 , and 1917 big games as rugby against santa clara and california s football big game in those years was against washington , but both schools desired to restore the old traditions . the onset of world war i gave stanford an out : in 1918 , the stanford campus was designated as           california , nevada , and utah , and the commanding officer , sam m. parker , decreed that football was the appropriate athletic activity to train soldiers and rugby was dropped . after the war , stanford resumed its football program and relegated rugby to a minor sport . several stanford rugby players who played during those yearsincluding daniel carroll , dink templeton , morris kirksey , erwin righter , john patrick , and charles doewent on to win a gold medal for the united states in rugby at the 1920 summer olympics .  season results   1906 season  in its first season of rugby , stanford retained head football coach james f. lanagan as its first rugby coach . lanagan had coached the football team for three years , including an undefeated 1905 season . stanford won its first five games , including two wins over a visiting club team from vancouver . as winners of the first big game against california played as rugby , stanford competed against vancouver-area club teams for the cooper keith trophy , losing two games and tying one . when stanford           american football as its major gridiron sport .  schedule  sitestadium = stanford field
the deaf community over time has worked to improve the educational system for those who are deaf and hard of hearing . the history of deaf education dates back to ancient egypt where the deaf were respected and revered . in contrast , those who were deaf in ancient greece were considered a burden to society and put to death . the educational aspects of the deaf community has evolved tremendously and still continues to grow as new technologies , laws , and educational strategies on local , national , and international levels are steadily being introduced .  ancient egypt  during the bc era , the disabled were not harmed or killed by the egyptians despite the fact that they had birth defects . this is due to the fact that the egyptians lived by a philanthropic way of life . many of the disabled citizens displayed talents that were not easily acquired . the deaf were considered to be especially selected by the gods because of their peculiar behavior . this behavior was a direct result of their disability to hear and desire to communicate           the use of hieroglyphs and gesture signs .  ancient greece  sign language was first documented in ancient greece . in one of plato s dialogues he describes how the deaf used gestures to mimic moving objects through similar motions . plato quotes his teacher socrates in the cratylus as follows : if we had neither voice nor tongue , and yet wished to manifest things to one another , should we not , like those which are at present mute , endeavor to signify our meaning by the hands , head , and other parts of the body ? .... i think , therefore that if we wished to signify that which is upwards and light , we should raise our hands towards the heaven , imitating the nature of the thing itself ; but that if we wished to indicate things downwards and heavy , we should point with our hands to the earth .. unlike ancient egypt , the greeks felt it was better to kill anyone with a disability . the deaf were especially considered a burden in athens , where it was believed that anyone           to death . the city of athens felt that ending the lives of those impaired was in the best interests of the state . this was due to the fact that war and conflict occurred continuously and certain abilities were considered important to have . everyone was meant to serve the state . philosopher aristotle along with greek physician galen concluded that the deaf could never speak , believing that the ability to speak and hear were linked ; being derived from the same area in the brain . galen , feeling that if one capability was impaired the other would be impaired also , was considered to be correct . additionally aristotle s views , which were similarly related to galen s , were also viewed as accurate and this idea went unchallenged until the sixteenth century a.d.  key figures   pedro ponce de leon a spanish benedictine monk  during the mid-sixteenth century brothers pedro and francisco fernandez velasco y tovar , were sent to live in a monastery by the name of ona where they were under the guidance of pedro ponce de leon . the           powerful families in spain . at that time , the noble families sent their disabled children to monasteries because it was believed that the children s disabilities were directly related to the sins of the parents . for this reason , the families hid their children because they were ashamed . during this time ten percent of children born to noble families were deaf . this was due to the fact that noble families in spain during this time married their blood relatives to keep the wealth within the family . the velasco boys were placed under the care of ponce because of their attachment to him when they arrived at the monastery . ponce himself had become attached to the boys and decided to educate them . many critics credit ponce with being the first person to educate the deaf , but it is stated by van cleve in deaf history unveiled that he was in fact not the first person to educate the deaf but the first person to teach the deaf to speak . he then argues that a monk from la estrella , whose name is not           with educating the deaf . contrastingly in the history of deaf people written by per eriksson , he credits st. john of beverley with being the first person to educate the deaf . st. john was the archbishop of york , england around 700 a.d. he is considered to be the first to disagree with aristotle s opinion of a deaf person s ability to learn .  sign language  communication came from both the homes of the deaf in addition to the monasteries they were sent to .  19th century   advocates   thomas fox  thomas fox was born on november 16 , 1859 . he became deaf at age ten after having spinal meningitis . soon after his parents enrolled him in the new york school for the deaf in which he became a part of the deaf community . after leaving the new york school for the deaf he enrolled in gallaudet college in 1879 . during his time at gallaudet , fox went to a meeting for the national association of the deaf . while at this meeting fox became a promoter           preconceptions against deaf people made in an attempt to remove certain cultural aspects of the deaf community . however , the specifics of the criticisms were not mentioned in detail . fox wanted deaf schools to remain active , along with the job availability for deaf instructors and language interpretation within the classes . after graduating from gallaudet he returned to his grade school in new york to teach . after his retirement he remained involved in the school s activities until his death in 1945.  20th century   cochlear implant  the cochlear implant is a device surgically implanted in the skull that provides stimulation to the nerve to promote hearing . it is a prosthetic with wires attached to the cochlea and is located behind the ear . the cochlear implant has a microphone , connecting cables , a speech processor , and a battery . the processor converts sounds into electrical impulses by taking information from sound patterns and producing an electrical pulse in the ear of the host . although the implant does provide an artificial means by which its hosts can hear , this           does not elevate sound . with this implant , sounds are not the same as sounds that a hearing person experiences . since the cochlear implant is in fact brain surgery , it destroys the cochlea in the process of implantation . teaching recipients to understand the sounds they hear takes years and there is no guarantee they will be able to make sense of the information . therefore the cochlear implant is not able to give all deaf people hearing and speech .  economic/job opportunities  during the mid to late 20th century , a study showed that two-thirds of american adults with disabilities did not have a job . it was also found that around eighty percent of those unemployed had the desire to work . employers often said they did not provide adequate accommodations for those with disabilities . they were also unsure if they could trust those persons with disabilities to perform requested tasks correctly . as result of these problems the americans with disabilities act of 1990 was ratified . this prevented discrimination against those with disabilities in both private and governmental           providing needed accommodations on the employer .  21st century   efforts around the world   china  since more individuals with disabilities live in china than any other country in the world , special education has become an important area of focus . china once had great ideological resources in this field ; yet , the schools for the disabled created in the late nineteenth century were established by western missionaries . since the late nineteen hundreds the legislation has expressed its concern and made efforts to encourage the progress of special education in china .  canada  in canada , efforts have been made to adopt a bilingual-bicultural model of education , using american sign language as its standard language for instruction . it is assumed that this approach will lead to an enhancement in learning , expression and achievement in deaf students .  international laws   disability acts   australia  national and worldwide legislation has focused an increasing amount of attention on the values of inclusion . this attitude is geared toward those with disabilities . inclusive education           attitudes concerning students with disabilities . unescos education policy was approved at the salamanca conference in 1944 and establishes the privilege to education for all disabled students . it has been considered a basic human right despite the fact that disabled students will need adequate accommodations . the international focus has been placed on the rights of children as well . world leaders have made a commitment to find ways to increase the amount of children who attend school . in result the national policies have been impacted by these developments . in australia , the viewpoint of education has been modeled after those international trends . australia has made efforts to see that all of their students are educated . moreover the disability discrimination act of 1992 has played an important role in support of education for the disabled as well . australia has presented itself as a country in great support of human rights . this act was implemented with the intent to secure the rights of the disabled . additionally the disability discrimination act has three key purposes : to discourage discrimination , to promote           insure the acceptance of the disabled by communities .  africa  south africas constitution and the integrated national disability strategy along with other legislation claims to be one of the most proactive methods in support of the disable . yet , most of the sentimentality does not exceed policy level and the enforcement of these guidelines has trailed far behind .  asl training  american sign language is used both in the united states and in english speaking parts of canada . it is considered a language although it is produced with gestures and seen with the eyes . since asl does not require the use of voice or the ability to hear it is used by deaf persons . sign language is collective worldwide ; instead it is similar to other languages having different signs in different cultures . a resident from great britain does not necessarily understand asl because britain and america have two different sign languages even though both countries primarily speak english and the written language is quite parallel . actually asl is more closely related to french sign ; sharing the           from one another . yet another misunderstanding is that asl can be directly translated to the english language . this however is false , when the grammar is compared asl and english are just as different as any two native languages . contrary to what has been presumed sign languages do have a specific format . they are not just different signs representing a word combined together to create speech . as oral languages have a particular format in which the words are presented , sign languages has its own format as well . just as errors are made in the english language with a slight mispronunciation or mistaken letter arrangement , asl can have the same errors with just a slight difference in gestures that are similar . this does not mean that grammar rules of oral language is in anyway directly related to that of sign language , but the same concept can be taken into account . although we can compare the processes of developing asl with that of the spoken english language the difference between the two must be recognized . the qualitative factor of asl is           phonetic structure of oral languages , with relatively few suprasegmental features , contrasts with a greater degree of simultaneity in sign languages . sign languages have four simultaneously realized parameters : hand configuration , location , movement and orientation . hand configuration , location and movement are what determine what is being signed . a simple combination of words can differ in just location , movement , or the way in which you hold your hand as you are signing .  politics   equality  during the early 1900s membership to various deaf organizations was denied to african americans . associations and even some churches prevented african americans from becoming members including the national association of the deaf and the national fraternal society of the deaf . there were fewer people to relate to who shared the same ethnic background and many of the caucasian deaf leaders made no attempt to improve the quality of the black deaf community . during this time racism was more prevalent and there were perhaps shared views of the blacks by both hearing and deaf white males . because of this national black           made against deaf women . colleges produced more male graduates than female , and deaf females were completely excluded or had only limited access to various club affiliations . they were also given easier workloads by teachers . associations at national and state levels had no or only small amounts of actual participation by women . women were often allowed to give their opinions or share their ideas for support of the preservation of sign language and the deaf community , but they did not hold any authoritative positions that allowed them to make decisions on behalf of the deaf community . even though they had a tough time being heard , deaf women still continued to seek involvement in language and cultural preservation . they eventually begin to establish their own clubs and organizations in which they expressed their ideas and views on issues concerning the deaf community . associations such as the camp fire girls at state schools and the owls at gallaudet college were formed in support of deaf women of caucasian ethnicity.  preservation of sign language  the deaf community made continuous efforts to help preserve           the language and promote oral communication . the attempt to supplant sign language , by the hearing , lead to the production of dictionaries and films intended to expose and promote sign language in the oral community as well as the deaf . many deaf people spent most of their free time socializing with their deaf peers and joined clubs within the deaf community after graduating from school . their efforts continued in the promotion of the preservation of sign language .

birthplace = *battle of long island *battle of assunpink creek *battle of brandywine *battle of germantown *battle of monmouth henry monckton was the fourth son of john monckton , 1st viscount galway and the younger half-brother of the more famous robert monckton . during the american revolutionary war he led a battalion of converged british grenadiers while a lieutenant colonel . he was wounded at long island during the new york and new jersey campaign in 1776 . he led a temporary brigade at assunpink creek . in the philadelphia campaign of 1777 he led a grenadier battalion at both brandywine and germantown . he was killed leading his soldiers at the battle of monmouth on 28 june 1778.  early career  born on 13 july 1740 , monckton was the fourth son of john monckton , 1st viscount galway , although the second by his second wife , jane westenra of rathleagh , queen s county , ireland . his older           high ranking general officer in the british army , as later did his nephew , henry , the son of his brother edward monckton , a nabob and member of parliament . monckton s only sister , mary , was a famous blue-stocking and later presided over an important literary and political salon . monckton commanded the 45th foot from 25 july 1771 until 1772 . he was wounded at the battle of long island on 22 august 1776 while leading the 1st grenadier battalion in the army of sir william howe with the rank of lieutenant colonel . at time of the battle of trenton on 26 december 1776 , he served as acting commander of major general james robertson s 1st british brigade at new york city . after trenton disaster , he took command of an   ad hoc   brigade consisting of william medows  1st grenadier battalion , his own 2nd grenadier battalion , and james ogilvie s 2nd guards battalion . leading this force , he went to new jersey with lord charles cornwallis and fought at the battle of the assunpink creek           washington outmaneuvered the british and defeated them at the battle of princeton . in the aftermath , cornwallis made a rapid retreat to his base at new brunswick , new jersey .  philadelphia campaign  at the battle of brandywine on 11 september 1777 , monckton led the 2nd grenadier battalion , which was formed from 15 grenadier companies taken from the regiments of foot . as the british advanced south from osborne s hill , the left flank of the 2nd grenadiers touched the birmingham road while the 1st grenadiers deployed on their right . the battalion struck thomas conway s 3rd pennsylvania brigade , driving it back . near sunset , the advancing 2nd grenadiers walked into a trap set by george weedon s fresh virginia brigade , which was deployed on a reverse slope with its right flank thrown forward so as to take the british line in enfilade . once he found his troops in a tight spot , monckton asked hessian captain johann von ewald to ride back and summon reinforcements . ewald located james agnew who brought his 4th brigade up on monckton s           finally dislodged the americans as darkness fell , but not before the 64th foot lost 47 casualties . the grenadiers also suffered serious losses at brandywine . of the 10 british officers killed in the engagement , seven were from the two grenadier battalions , and an additional seven grenadier officers were wounded , including medows , shot in the arm . on 26 september 1777 , the british army marched into the rebel capital of philadelphia , pennsylvania . one witness remembered monckton leading both british grenadier battalions . his circle of friends among the british officers included sir george osborn , 4th baronet , william harcourt , richard fitzpatrick , and sir john wrottesley , 8th baronet . on 4 october the battle of germantown was fought . monckton double-timed his grenadiers from their barracks in philadelphia to the field of action . on the way they passed the slower-moving hessian grenadiers . led by cornwallis , the grenadiers arrived just as the american attack collapsed . they led the pursuit up germantown road as far as chestnut hill .  death at monmouth  in march 1778 ,           1st viscount sackville sent orders permitting the evacuation of philadelphia . worried about being trapped in the delaware river by a french fleet , the new british commander henry clinton determined to move most of his army to new york by land . the naval transports were packed with most of the army s women and children , 3,000 loyalist civilians , sick soldiers , and the unreliable ansbach-bayreuth mercenaries . the transports set sail early on 18 june 1778 . that day , philadelphia was abandoned and clinton s army marched east to haddonfield , new jersey . from there clinton s army marched in a northeasterly direction via mount holly , bordentown , allentown , and imlaystown . wilhelm von knyphausen s leading division reached monmouth court house on 26 june to be joined shortly by cornwallis  division . after his army rested on the 26th and 27th , clinton planned to move northeast to sandy hook where naval transports would take his army to new york . meanwhile , washington moved his army northeast from valley forge , pennsylvania and crossed the delaware at coryell s ferry           , new jersey and moved east to intercept clinton . after some hesitation , washington appointed his second-in-command , charles lee to lead his advance guard . at 4:00 am on 28 june 1778 , knyphausen s division began its march from monmouth court house , followed at 8:00 am by cornwallis  division . lee failed to scout the terrain and told his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances . he only began moving forward at 7:00 am with 5,000 troops and 10 cannons . when lee arrived near the british positions , clinton turned back to assist his rear guard with strong forces , including the two grenadier battalions . after some attacks miscarried , lee s division retreated with clinton in pursuit . at length , lee s withdrawing troops met washington s main body moving forward . washington relieved lee of command , but apparently relented and allowed lee to cobble together a defensive line with the troops at hand . he placed varnum s brigade , then under the command of jeremiah olney behind a hedgerow .           on olney s left . farther to the left , anthony wayne directed soldiers led by walter stewart and nathaniel ramsey into some woods . lee s chief of artillery , eleazer oswald placed two cannons on olney s right and two more in support of wayne s troops . stewart and ramsey ambushed the 1st guards battalion as it passed by . though their commander colonel henry trelawney and 40 men were hit , the brigade of guards and two companies of the 1st grenadier battalion rushed the woods . in a hard-fought action , the americans were flushed from the trees and set upon by the 16th light dragoons in the open . stewart was wounded and ramsey wounded and captured as their commands raced to cross a bridge to the west side of the ravine . the 16th light dragoons tried to charge the hedgerow but olney s men repulsed them with a blast of gunfire . clinton personally led forward the 2nd grenadiers and one wing of the 1st grenadiers , calling out , charge , grenadiers , never heed forming . case shot from oswald s           m , but they stormed the hedgerow anyway , driving back olney s men . during the desperate action , washington s chief of artillery henry knox ordered oswald to pull back . covered by olney s brigade , he managed to get across the bridge without losing any guns . the action was so chaotic that a party of 16 grenadiers found themselves amid olney s brigade , but the americans were so focused on getting away that they paid no attention to their enemies . sometime during the action at the hedgerow , a british officer saw monckton fall , struck by grape shot . he detailed some of his soldiers to retrieve his commander , but apparently this was not done . after the battle some men of the 1st pennsylvania regiment found monckton . the mortally wounded officer was taken to the old tennent church where he died the same day . oddly , clinton did not mention monckton in his report of the battle . however , hessian adjutant general carl leopold baurmeister wrote , colonel monckton was killed , a great loss indeed . monckton           new jersey . the inscription on his grave marker reads ,  lt. col. henry monckton who on the plains of monmouth 28 june 1778 sealed with his life his duty and devotion to his king and country . this memorial erected by samuel fryer whose father a subject of great britain sleeps in an unknown grave .  because he was found by men of the 1st pennsylvania , a legend grew up that monckton was killed while attacking that regiment late in the battle . it was supposed that they not only recovered his body but the colors of his regiment . in fact , the grenadier battalions carried no colors and monckton fell around noon . in one account , monckton s mortal wounding and the loss of the colors came late in the day at the hands of anthony wayne s troops in front

the early 2012 hong kong protests were a series of protests by residents of hong kong against chinese peking university professor kong qingdong , who had made televised remarks suggesting that many hong kong people were disloyal to china and still harboured a colonial mentality . kong was responding to the release of a survey finding that hong kong people feel increasingly separate from , and superior to , mainland chinese people . anti-mainland chinese sentiment in hong kong is growing because of the perception that mainland chinese mothers are flocking to hong kong to give birth . about 150 people gathered at the chinese liaison office on january 22 in order to protest kong s remarks . and since leung chun-ying elected and inaugurated as chief executive of hong kong , protests of anti-government of hong kong sar and central government increases ongoing .  background   cultural identity  since 1997 , university of hong kong professor robert chung had been regularly conducting surveys on how residents in hong kong view their own identity . in december 2011 , chung s poll showed           , and only 34% thought of the same way of being chinese first . this is the highest ratio of those who consider themselves primarily as hong kong residents since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 . after chung published his results , two pro-beijing newspapers in hong kong ,   wen wei po   and   ta kung pao   alleged that chung was a political fraudster with evil intentions to incite people to deny they are chinese . one pro-beijing columnist asked whether chung s actions are subversive , and whether his scholarship is a slave of political bribery . chung rejected the charges of bias and released a statement that the cultural revolution-style curses and defamations are not conducive to the building of chinese national identity among hong kong people . another professor targeted was dixon sing of hong kong university of science and technology . in december 2011 pro-beijing media said he was an anti-china western trained vicious dog because he gave interviews to falun gong media . but his real issue may have been to support the 2010 five constituencies           released to ask the university to fire him . the communist party officials see both professors as a connection between pro-democracy movements and the way hk people see themselves . the students  union have since come out to protect professor sing in a public statement about the one country , two systems being violated . they believe that regardless of pro-establishment or pro-democratic views , the views need to be respected in order for academic freedom to exist .  influx of birth tourism  on 1 january 2012 a protest was held by more than 1,500 pregnant women and mothers with strollers against the number of mainland chinese mothers giving birth in the city . in 2001 , the court of final appeal ruled in   director of immigration v. chong fung yuen   that hong kong-born children of chinese citizens were entitled to the right of abode in hong kong even if their parents had entered the territory as tourists . this ruling sparked a sharp rise in the number of mainland chinese mothers coming to hong kong to give birth . hong kong hospitals have           . in 2011 nearly half of all babies born in hong kong were born to mainland chinese mothers aiming for their children to get the right of abode so they could obtain education in hong kong . hong kong in general has one of the world s lowest birth rates . the hospital systems are stressed . nurses in the region have accused the city s government of being incompetent and said hong kong residents should be prioritised over non-locals . for 2012 the hong kong government reduced the quota for number of mainland chinese women allowed to give birth in public hospitals . the quota call was made after doctors themselves made a rare public call to pressure the government to put a stop on the number of babies allowed as resources were stretched too thin . the cap is now set at 3,400 for public and 31,000 for private hospitals . chief executive donald tsang announced a four point plan to hold back the wave of mainland chinese women . heavy charges are imposed on non-locals who turn up at emergency stops to           resources for border checks . local authorities will crack down on people who assist women enter the territories . more raids will be done on unlicensed pregnant women hotels . about hk$6.6 million of public hospitals  bad debt in 2010-11 was from non-local mothers not paying their bills .  property investment  many hong kong citizens blame wealthy mainland chinese for driving property prices beyond the reach of local citizens . in 2011 mainland chinese purchased a third of all residential flats in hong kong , according to nomura research . home prices also rose as much as 70% since 2009.  incident   eating while on mtr controversy  in january 2012 , ken wai , a hong kong passenger , asked a mainland chinese woman and her child to stop eating on an mtr subway in mandarin chinese on a train bound for mong kok east station . eating and drinking is not allowed on the mtr . while the kid stopped eating , the mother accused him of making trouble and laughed at his bad mandarin chinese . this infuriated mr. wai who started the           had to stop the train , and ask both parties to get off the train to solve disputes . on 18 january mr. wai conducted an interview with xinhua news agency on the issue and expressed his anger .  kong qingdong s remarks  a harsh public comment on followed this incident by the controversial professor kong qingdong from peking university who is known for his nationalist views and use of profanity . he responded publicly you hongkongers are chinese , right ? but as i know , many hongkongers do nt think they are chinese . they claim that we are hongkongers , you are chinese . they are bastards . those kinds of people used to be running dogs for the british colonialists . and until now , you hongkongers are still dogs . you are nt human . kong then claimed that hong kong citizens had failed to accept their responsibility to speak the real chinese language mandarin chinese because of the residues of colonialism . he then threatened if hongkongers keep discriminating against mainlanders mainland chinese in that way , then we wo nt provide the           and asked can hongkongers still survive ? go to seek help from your british daddy . after exposure by the media , however , kong qingdong claimed that he only made the remarks for the hong kong peoples benefit , and that he only called some people dogs . according to   ming pao   , kong claimed that normal people , educated people should all understand what he meant , and that he thinks every place has some people who are dogs . some beijing people are dogs . if someone really says that all hong kong people are dogs , then i agree , that person should apologize . since the only party claiming that hong kong people are dogs is   southern daily   . i demand that they apologize to both the hong kong people and me ! the online video network that published kongs remarks later claimed that kongs views do not represent the networks .  protests  many hong kong citizens were infuriated by his remarks , and hong kong s   open   magazine openly asked for           as suggesting that the communist party of china has been supporting kong qingdong behind the scene . petitions for expelling kong from peking university , which was previously called for when he rejected the   southern weekly   interview with an expression of profanity , was also renewed . on 22 january 2012 , about 150 protesters gathered at the liaison office to protest against kong qingdong s statement . people brought their pet dogs and carried signs saying we are not dogs . some protesters claimed that hong kongers dislike the communist party precisely because the party had , in their views , deformed chinese culture and tradition .  reaction   kong qingdong  kong criticized the protest as an attempt to suppress freedom of speech through government action . chinese reaction to kongs remarks had been divided ; while some criticized his insult on the hong kong people , others have expressed support for kong .  hong kong electoral candidates  both running candidates for the next chief executives position , henry tang and leung chun-ying have come out to complain           saying professor kong qingdong needs to be responsible for his own statement and that hong kong citizens are not dogs . he emphasized this is how hong kong citizens deal with each other in a free society . leung chun-ying responded by saying that kong s statement did not actually reflect the views of mainland chinese . he added that this is part of the hong kong spirit to respect the law , and that professor kong qingdong should not be overreacting.  other notable response  * the prominent chinese artist and dissident ai weiwei complained about peking university s tolerance of kong qingdong s behavior , calling peking university a nest of turtles . * susan tse , a hong kong opera actress and a fellow descendant of confucius , criticized kong qingdong s lack of tolerance and respect of the hong kong people . tse further suggested that kong should apologize to the hong kong people . * the chinese scholar and television personality yi zhongtian criticized kong s remarks , calling kong s characterization of speakers of non-mandarin chinese dialects as bastards an affront to thousands of           yi would rather be a bastard than agree with kong . * the hong kong actor anthony wong also rebuked kong s remarks , suggesting that if the hong kong people are dogs , then kong qingdong is a blood relative of dogs . * an analysis was done by yzzk , who gave many examples of popular youtube links showing mainland chinese misbehaving every day in hong kong causing anger . it also highlight many chinese events such as fight for democracy during the 1989 protest , help with activists in need , help with territorial dispute , disaster relief and many more events that hk citizens participated in and were overlooked . * jack so , former mtr chairman and cppcc member who was born in taiwan , said we are all the same , we are all chinese with the same surnames .  advertisement controversy   anti-chinese advertisements  members of the hong kong golden forum raised more than hk$100,000 to purchase a full-page advertisement in   apple daily   .           featured a giant locust overlooking the city skyline of hong kong . locusts stereotypically represent mainland chinese . the ad makes the statement would you like to see hong kong spend hk$1 million every 18 minutes on the children of non-hong kongers ? hong kongers have had enough ! we demand the unlimited infiltration of mainland chinese couples into hong kong . the advertisement also employs the derogative term double illegitimacy , which refers to residents of hong kong with both parents of illegal status within the territory . protesters also argued against hong kong basic law article 24 , although rita fan have already said these newborns do not qualify for right of abode . hong kong protesters also launched anti-mainland chinese groups on facebook that reached high popularity , prompting local media to refer to it as an anti-locusts campaign . at least one entry on sina microblog has been reposted 97,000 times and received 30,000 comments according to the   global times   . the hong kong equal opportunities commission expressed concern over the full-page advertisement ; chairman lam woon-kwong said that vilifying remarks           and rational debate . the communist party has long been known for ignoring pro-democracy groups and denying certain citizens home return permits and other rights .  mainland chinese response  mainland chinese microblogs launched a retaliatory advertisement against the locust slur , claiming that if it was nt the mainland chinese treating you like a son , you would have died long ago . we must not allow this son to ride on our shoulders anymore . let s temporarily cut off the son s water , electricity and food !  copycat advertisement : shanghai grassroot against other mainland chinese response  a similarly duplicate ad by shanghai grassroots reused the same picture posted from the hk golden forum , but the words were changed . this copycat ad claims 4 billion rmb is spent each year to subsidize non-locals in shanghai . in shanghainese dialect it declares shanghainese have had enough . because you have come for the gold rush , we have to receive 17,566,700 outsiders .  additional controversy   democracy wall  around 7 feb , at the democracy wall           inscribing the words in chinese characters : anti-locusts . the case have been under investigation . some students believe this type of vandalism on the democracy wall is just a response to mainland chinese society not tolerating democracy .  tension extends to university  the tension between hk and mainland china has extended to universities where between 2010 to 2011 mainland chinese students were granted 2/3 of the scholarships . there were limited resources available to begin with , now these hk citizens have to compete with mainland chinese for education , scholarships and jobs post study . chinese university of hong kong vice chancellor joseph sung have recognized the uneasiness about the situation . the cultural differences also add to the tension where many students from hk and mainland china ca nt live together in some campuses .  tension extends to singapore  a mainland chinese student sun xu from jiangsu province under chinese government scholarship at the national university of singapore wrote a message in singapore there are more dogs than humans on internet forums . sun xu faced disciplinary actions and the           comment is said to be influenced by kong qingdong . while the comment has raised many issues , some people have agreed . a comment followed by a mr. lin who said singaporeans are descendants of yan and yellow emperor who bleed chinese blood . there is no need to rename a chinese into a singaporean.  conflict between hong kong and chinese reporters  on 10 march 2012 , a press conference on the issue of mainland chinese mothers giving birth in hong kong was held by guangdong governor zhu xiaodan . as the conference was about to end , rthk reporter chan liu-ling asked for hong kong reporters to be given a chance to ask questions . instead the host let reporter lu hong-chao from hong kong commercial daily ask the last question . as lu is a mainland chinese , some hong kong reporters were unhappy and said he is nt from hong kong . after the press conference , a fight broke out between lu and tvb reporter cheng sze-ting . lu who thought that cheng made the comment ,           journalist pass from her chest . when lu hong-chao attempted to leave , cheng sze-ting , chan miu-ling and other hong kong reporters surrounded him and requested an apology . at the time other mainland chinese reporters joined the quarrel and questioned whether cheng was discriminating against mainland chinese , despite the mainland chinese host of the press conference host picking on mainland chinese during the q&amp;a session .

the willem river or willems river was named during the voyage of the dutch east india company ship   mauritius   in 1618 , under the command of supercargo willem janszoon and captained by lenaert jacobszoon , and is one of the few features named on a nautical chart made in 1627 . from that information willems river would almost certainly have been named after supercargo , willem janszoon , the commander of the ship   mauritius   . janszoon was captain of the duyfken in 1605-1606 , when part of the gulf of carpentaria was mapped , during the earliest documented visit to australia by a vessel from the netherlands .   caert va nt landt van deendracht   is a 1627 chart made by hessel gerritsz and is one of the earliest charts showing the coastline of western australia . the willems river is located to the extreme left end of the coastline on the chart and a closer view is           it is believed that the willems river of 1618 is the ashburton river . cite journal the chart shows   willems revier , besocht by  t volck van  t schip mauritius in iulius a 1618   . the detail of the rivers position on the chart , backs up the claim that this is the ashburton river , which , being at 21 degrees 40 minutes south and 114 degrees 56 east , is almost exactly the latitude shown on the chart . the chart is oriented with north to the left , showing lines of latitude from 20th parallel south to the 35th parallel south at the base of the map . the lines of latitude appear to be very accurate , matching closely known features through the length of the chart . other factors to back up that this is the ashburton river is that it takes almost a 90 degree turn north-east , once in the mouth , as           the river mouth in reality is of the same shape as shown on the chart .  1627 chart accuracy  a note on the chart s accuracy is given by the author heeres in 1899 , from the following excerpt .  the 1627 chart is specially interesting . gerritsz. , at the time cartographer in ordinary to the e.i.c. , has put together this chart of the landt van deendracht from the journals and drawings of the steersmen , which means that he availed himself of authentic data *** . he acquitted himself of the task to admiration , and has given a very lucid survey of the discoveries made by the dutch on the west-coast of australia . in this chart of 1627 the land of deendracht takes up a good deal of space . to the north it is found bounded by the willemsrivier , discovered in july 1618 by the ship mauritius , commanded by willem janszoon **** . according to the chart this river is in about 21 45  s. lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point           not use all the data then available . thus , for instance , he left unused those furnished by the zeewolf , and those of the ship leiden . **** see the documents under no ix .  what heeres means by the sentence ,   according to the chart this river is in about 21 45  s. lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point ,   is that in 1899 they had no reliable information about exactly what was at that latitude .    mauritius   at north west cape  on 31 july 1618 , the   mauritius   reached north west cape , where crew members went ashore and saw footprints ; this was the closest that europeans had yet come to making contact with indigenous australians in western australia . janszoon and jacobszoon assumed that the cape was an island : the notion           extent that it was named cloates island in 1720 and this misconception lingered until the 19th century . as the willems river was also named in july it would appear that the   mauritius   , which reached bantam the 1627 chart was based on a number of voyages , beginning with the 1616 voyage of dirk hartog . on that voyage hartog named eendrachtsland after his ship , the   eendracht   meaning unity . eendrachtsland is one of the earliest names given to the australian mainland .  notes

in the field of computer vision , velocity moments are weighted averages of the intensities of pixels in a sequence of images , similar to image moments but in addition to describing an object s shape also describe its motion through the sequence of images . velocity moments can be used to aid automated identification of a shape in an image when information about the motion is significant in its description . there are currently two established versions of velocity moments : cartesianj . d. shutler , m. s. nixon , c. j. harris , statistical gait description via temporal moments , proc . ssiai 2000 - austin , texas , : pp. 291-295 , 2000 and zernike.j . d. shutler and m. s. nixon , zernike velocity moments for description and recognition of moving shapes , proc . bmvc 2001 , manchester , uk , 2:pp. 705-714 , 2001  cartesian velocity moments   cartesian moments for single images  a cartesian moment of a single image is calculated by : mpq = sumx=1m sumy=1n xp yq pxy where m and           pxy is the intensity of the pixel at the point in the image , and xp yq is the basis function .  cartesian velocity moments for sequences of images  cartesian velocity moments are based on these cartesian moments . a cartesian velocity moment vmpqmugamma is defined by : vmpqmugamma = sumi=2images sumx=1m sumy=1n u c pixy where m and n are again the dimensions of the image , images is the number of images in the sequence , and pixy is the intensity of the pixel at the point in image i . c is taken from central moments , added so the equation is translation invariant , defined as : c = p q where overlinexi is           for image i , and similarly for y . u introduces velocity into the equation as : u = mu gamma where overlinexi-1 is the x coordinate of the centre of mass for the previous image , i-1 , and again similarly for y . after the cartesian velocity moment is calculated , it can be normalised by : overlinevmpqmugamma = frac vmpqmugammaa * i where a is the average area of the object , in pixels , and i is the number of images . now the value is not affected by the number of images in the sequence or the size of the object . as cartesian moments are non-orthogonal , so are cartesian velocity moments , so different moments can be closely correlated . these velocity moments do however provide translation and scale invariance .           images  a zernike moment of a single image is calculated by : amn = frac m + 1pi sumx sumy vmn * pxy where * denotes the complex conjugate , m is an integer between 0 and infty , and n is an integer such that m - n is even and n **10;257747; . for calculating zernike moments , the image , or section of the image which is of interest is mapped to the unit disc , then pxy is the intensity of the pixel at the point on the disc and x2 + y2 le 1 is a restriction on values of x and y . the coordinates are then mapped to polar coordinates , and r and theta are the polar coordinates of the point on the unit disc map . vmn is           vmn = rmnejntheta : rmn = sums=0frac m-n2 s f : f = frac ! s ! ! ! rm-2s  zernike velocity moments for sequences of images  zernike velocity moments are based on these zernike moments . a zernike velocity moment amnmugamma is defined by : amnmugamma = frac m + 1pi sumi=2images sumx=1 sumy=1 u vmn * pixy where images is again the number of images in the sequence , and pixy is the intensity of the pixel at the point on the unit disc mapped from image i . u introduces velocity into the equation in the same way as in the cartesian velocity moments and           the zernike moments equation above . like the cartesian velocity moments , zernike velocity moments can be normalised by : overlineamnmugamma = frac amnmugammaa * i where a is the average area of the object , in pixels , and i is the number of images . as zernike velocity moments are based on the orthogonal zernike moments , they produce less correlated and more compact descriptions than cartesian velocity moments . zernike velocity moments also provide translation and scale invariance .  comparison of methods   references

glencairn s rising was a royalist uprising in 1653 in scotland against the protectorate of oliver cromwell . it was led by william cunningham , 9th earl of glencairn , who was given command of the royalist forces in scotland by charles ii . he convened a meeting of scottish notables , such as blackadder of tullyallan , who then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army . the governor of stirling castle , colonel kidd , sallied out to suppress this force but was defeated by them at aberfoyle . glencairn s forces also fought against cromwell at the battle of tullich in 1652 . the royalist army continued to grow but dissension developed when command was reassigned from glencairn to john middleton , 1st earl of middleton . this was largely due to petty disputes between glencairn s and middleton s respective forces . the former being mainly scottish lowlanders and the latter being mainly scottish highlanders . this eventually led to a duel between one of middleton s officers , sir george munro and glencairn himself . they duelled           was placed under arrest by the orders of middleton and his sword was taken from him . the following day two junior officers from the two camps had a duel of their own in which one was killed and the other was later arrested and hanged . john middleton , 1st earl of middleton was later defeated at the battle of dalnaspidal on 19 july 1654 and that ended the insurrection.  notes

naca report no. 964 - the effects of variations in reynolds number between 3.0 x 10 6 and 25.0 x 10 6 upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of naca 6-series airfoil sections was published by the united states national advisory committee for aeronautics in 1950 . it contained a series of graphs showing the resulting lift and drag of several naca 6-series airfoil sections from tests performed in a variable-density wind tunnel , in which the reynolds number was set at three different values .  summary  results are presented of an investigation made to determine the two-dimensional lift and drag characteristics of nine naca 6-series airfoil sections at rn of 15.0 , 20.0 , and 25.0 million . also presented are data from naca rep. 824 for the same airfoils at rn of 3.0 , 6.0 , and 9.0 million . the airfoils selected represent sections having variations in the airfoil thickness , thickness form , and camber . the characteristics of an airfoil with a split flap were determined in one instance , as was the           flow behavior are advanced for the observed types of scale effect .  introduction  two-dimensional aerodynamic data obtained at rn of 3.0 , 6.0 and 9.0 million are now generally available for a large number of systematically derived naca airfoil sections . this range of rn is sufficient to satisfy engineering needs for many practical applications , but the recent trends toward both very large and very high-speed aircraft have emphasized the necessity for aerodynamic data at higher values . an investigation has accordingly been made of the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of systematically varied naca 6-series airfoils at rn of 15.0 , 20.0 and 25.0 million . the results of this investigation at high rn together with those for the same airfoils at lower rn are presented in report no. 964 . the naca 63 series was chosen as the basic group for investigation because these airfoils appear to offer good low-speed characteristics with a minimum of compromise from consideration of the high-speed characteristics . in all cases , only lift and drag were measured .  apparatus  all the tests were made in the langley two-dimensional           measures 3 x 7.5 feet , and the model completely spanned the 3-foot dimension . seals were installed between the ends of the model and the tunnel walls to prevent air leakage .  test results   drag  the reaction of the minimum drag coefficient of smooth airfoils to increasing rn is attributed to the relative strengths of two interacting boundary-layer changes . a thinning of the boundary layer with increasing rn gives a gradual decrease of minimum drag . as the rn is increased beyond a certain value , however , the transition point begins to move forward and the drag increases . the flow conditions of the thicker airfoils are more favorable for delaying the forward movement of transition . the addition of standard roughness to the naca 63-009 section causes a large increase in the minimum drag at all rn , but increasing the rn has a favorable effect in reducing the drag . increasing the rn from 9.0 to 15.0 million resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the low-drag range of all the airfoils except that of 18% thickness .  lift  the           no variation with rn . throughout the range of rn of this investigation , the values of the lift-curve slope for the smooth sections are very close to that predicted by thin-airfoil theory . the effects of increasing rn on the maximum lift showed two general trends : for airfoils of 12% thickness or less , the maximum lift remains relatively constant over the lower range of rn . increasing the rn , however , causes a rapid increase in maximum lift ; the 18% thick airfoils demonstrated a steady increase of maximum lift as rn is increased .  concluding remarks  the 18% thick section had a type of maximum-lift variation with the rn that was entirely different from the thinner sections . any comparison of airfoil maximum-lift characteristics can be made only if the data for the group of airfoils under consideration are available at the same rn . the choice of an optimum airfoil for maximum lift for a given applcation must be determined from data corresponding to the operating rn of the application .

melvin lawrence ember was an american cultural anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher with wide-ranging interests who combined an active research career with writing for nonprofessionals.  biography  drawn to anthropology after reading the works of margaret mead , he attended columbia university at the young age of 16 where he was further inspired by elman service and morton fried in the anthropology department . he then went on to yale university to study for his ph.d . in anthropology , primarily under the mentorship of george peter murdock . after a years postdoctoral work at yale , ember spent four years at the laboratory of socio-environmental studies at the national institute of health . he was professor at antioch college and hunter college . he also chaired the department of anthropology at hunter college of the city university of new york . here he succeeded in expanding the department significantly , attracting young scholars from major institutions .           of new york graduate program in anthropology from 1973 to 1975 . he was president of the society for cross-cultural research in 1981-1982 and in 1982 took over the editorship of cross-cultural research , a position he held until the time of his death . he moved to the new haven area in 1987 to become president of the human relations area files , an institution at yale whose mission is to foster the comparative study of culture . under his leadership , he helped revitalize the institution , moving its databases into the digital age .  work   fieldwork  in contrast to most cultural anthropologists at the time , who conducted their fieldwork in a single community , ember s fieldwork in american samoa was explicitly comparative , using community variation to test theories about culture change . he chose three communities differing in distance from the commercial center to evaluate how commercial involvement affected political change . his assessment of samoan kinship was subsequently challenged by derek freeman , long before the now-famous meadfreeman controversy about samoa . because ember knew , from           american samoa , he questioned how freeman , working in a very different time and in western samoa , could doubt meads veracity .  national institute of mental health  at the national institute of mental health embler worked on the universality of the familial incest taboo . since all societies prohibit familial incest , he decided to focus on cross-cultural variation in cousin marriage to try to understand why some societies allowed close cousin marriages while others forbade it . after evaluating the various explanatory hypotheses of the time , his own empirical research confirmed that much of the variation in cousin marriage could best be explained as an adaptation to the harmful effects of inbreeding .  cross-cultural work  as a professor at antioch college and hunter college ember continued his cross-cultural work on aspects of kinship and social organization , picking up first on topics that murdock was unable to explain , such as variation in post-marital residence and unilineal descent . traditional theories had focused on economic factors , such as which gender contributed most to the economy , but finding these explanations lacking in           particularly the effects of warfare in the social environment . because warfare seemed so central in explaining various aspects of social organization , he then turned to research that tested ideas about why societies varied in type and frequency of violence , looking at variation in warfare frequency , homicide , and corporal punishment of children in the anthropological record . believing that laws about human nature should hold true among technological complex as well as simpler societies , he persuaded political scientist bruce russett to join him and his wife carol r. ember in a project to test the theory that democracies do not fight each other . although the concepts of democracy and international war had to be transformed to fit the anthropological record , the results of their collaborative research were consistent with many studies conducted by political scientists . ember later worked with cross-cultural psychologists to explore the relationships between aggression and war .  interdisciplinary research  branching out into diverse and interdisciplinary research areas was not unusual for ember . indeed , he published scholarly articles in archaeology , linguistics , biological anthropology , and           of different anthropologists in far-flung places and across time could be used to test theories about why cultures varied or were similar and he devoted most of his research career to systematically testing explanations , rather than just expounding them . his passion for systematic comparative research on challenging questions in all areas of anthropology influenced a generation of younger scholars through his direction of the first summer institute for cross-cultural research in 1964 , his active participation in nsf-funded summer institutes in comparative research between 1991 and 1999 , and through the series of publications in comparative methods that resulted from these institutes .  publications  ember is widely known as the co-author of two major textbooks ,   anthropology   , and   cultural anthropology   , first published in 1973 and now in their 13th edition . he was also editor or co-editor of eight encyclopedias.

the terms macrophage and microphage are used in ecology to describe heterotrophs that consume food in two different ways . both macrophages and microphages ingest solid food and may process it through some sort of alimentary canal . however , a macrophage handles food items singly , while a microphage handles food items in bulk without manipulating them individually . microphages include suspension feeders , and often incidentally digest low-quality food items . another category of heterotrophs based on feeding mechanism , known as osmotrophs , is made up of organisms that absorb organism matter directly across their cell membranes . the terms macrophage and microphage were originally used in this sense by jordan and hirsch . although they have been used in ecology texts as recently as 2002 , the terms macrophage and microphage today are primarily used to describe two different types of white blood cells in the vertebrate immune system .
after world war ii and the collapse of the country s monarchy , the french attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the first indochina war . the geneva accords in 1954 partitioned the country temporarily in two with a promise of democratic election in 1956 to reunite the country . however , the united states and south vietnam insisted on united nations supervision of any election to prevent fraud , which the soviet union and north vietnam refused . the vietnam war ended with the fall of saigon in 1975 . after the reunification in 1975 , vietnam suffered further internal repression and isolation from the international community due to the cold war , vietnamese invasion of cambodia and an american economic embargo . in 1986 , the communist party of vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in the china . since the mid-1980s , vietnam has enjoyed substantial economic growth .  the birth of the republic  the japanese occupied vietnam during world war ii but allowed the french to           end in august 1945 , a power vacuum was created in vietnam . capitalizing on this , the vit minh launched the august revolution across the country to seize government offices . emperor bo i abdicated on august 25 , 1945 , ending the nguyn dynasty . on september 2 , 1945 , at ba nh square , ho chi minh , leader of the viet minh organization , declared vietnam s independence under the new name of the democratic republic of vietnam in a speech that invoked the united states declaration of independence and the french revolution s declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen . ho sent several letters to the us government asking to be recognised as the government of vietnam and offering friendship to america , but none were ever answered .  communist north &amp; capitalist south   indochina war  the british commander in southeast asia , lord louis mountbatten , sent 20,000 troops of the 20th indian division to occupy saigon under general douglas gracey who landed           japanese and restoring order . they had to re-arm japanese prisoners of war known as gremlin force to keep order until more troops arrived . the british began to withdraw in december 1945 , but this was not completed until june of the following year . the last british soldiers were killed in vietnam in june 1946 . altogether 40 british and indian troops were killed and over a hundred were wounded . vietnamese casualties were 600 . they were followed by french troops trying to re-establish their rule . in the north , chiang kai-shek s kuomintang army entered vietnam from china , also to disarm the japanese , followed by the forces of the non-communist vietnamese parties , such as vit nam quc dn ng and vit nam cch mng ng minh hi . in january 1946 , vietnam had its first national assembly election , which drafted the first constitution , but the situation was still precarious : the french tried to regain power by force ; some cochinchinese politicians formed a seceding government of the           non-communist and communist forces were engaging each other in sporadic battle . stalinists purged trotskyists . religious sects , like the cao i and ha ho , and resistance groups formed their own militias . accord between france and the democratic republic of vietnam , 6 march 1946 : : 1 . the french government recognizes the vietnamese republic as a free state having its own government , its own parliament , its own army and its own finances , forming part of the indochinese federation and of the french union . in that which concerns the reuniting of the three annamite regions cochinchina , annam , tonkin the french government pledges itself to ratify the decisions taken by the populations consulted by referendum . : 2 . the vietnamese government declares itself ready to welcome amicably the french army when , conforming to international agreements , it relieves the chinese troops . a supplementary accord , attached to the present preliminary agreement , will establish the means by which the relief operations will be carried out . : 3 . the stipulations formulated above will immediately enter into force .           high contracting parties will take all measures necessary to stop hostilities in the field , to maintain the troops in their respective positions , and to create the favorable atmosphere necessary to the immediate opening of friendly and sincere negotiations . these negotiations will deal particularly with : : : a. diplomatic relations of viet nam with foreign states : : b. the future law of indochina : : c . french interests , economic and cultural , in viet nam . the seat of the conference was held at either hanoi , saigon or paris . in 1947 full scale war broke out between the viet minh and france . realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , france fashioned a semi-independent state of vietnam , within the french union , with bo i as head of state . meanwhile , as the communists under mao zedong took over china , the viet minh began to receive military aid from china . beside supplying materials , chinese cadres also pressured the vietnamese communist party , then under first secretary trng chinh , to emulate their brand of revolution           the viet minh ranks , carrying out a ruthless and bloody land reform campaign , and denouncing bourgeois and feudal tendencies in arts and literature . many true patriots and devoted communist revolutionaries in the viet minh suffered mistreatment or were even executed during these movements . many others became disenchanted and left the viet minh . the united states became strongly opposed to h ch minh . in the 1950s the government of bo i gained recognition by the united states and the united kingdom . the vit minh force grew significantly with china s assistance and in 1954 , under the command of general v nguyn gip , launched a major siege against french bases in in bin ph . the vit minh force surprised western military experts with their use of primitive means to move artillery pieces and supplies up the mountains surrounding in bin ph , giving them a decisive advantage . on may 7 , 1954 , french troops at in bin ph , under christian de castries , surrendered to the viet minh and in july 1954 , the           paving the way for the french to leave vietnam .  vietnam war  the geneva conference of 1954 ended france s colonial presence in vietnam and partitioned the country into two states at the 17th parallel pending unification on the basis of internationally supervised free elections . ng nh dim , a former mandarin with a strong catholic and confucian background , was selected as premier of the state of vietnam by bo i . while dim was trying to settle the differences between the various armed militias in the south , bo i was persuaded to reduce his power . dim created a referendum in 1955 to depose bo i and declared himself president of the republic of vietnam . the republic of vietnam was proclaimed in saigon on october 26 , 1955 . the united states began to provide military and economic aid to the rvn , training rvn personnel , and sending u.s. advisors to assist in building the infrastructure for the new government . also in 1954 , viet minh forces took over north           vietnamese civilians emigrated to south vietnam to avoid persecution from the imminent communist regime . at the same time , viet minh armed forces from south vietnam were also moving to north vietnam , as dictated by the geneva accord . however , some high-ranking viet minh cadres secretly remained in the south to follow the local situation closely , and created a communist insurgency against the southern government if necessary . the most important figure among those was l dun . the geneva accord had promised elections to determine the government for a unified vietnam . neither the united states government nor ng nh dim s state of vietnam signed anything at the 1954 geneva conference . with respect to the question of reunification , the non-communist vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of vietnam , but lost out when the french accepted the proposal of viet minh delegate phm vn ng , who proposed that vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of local commissions . the united states countered with what became known as the american plan , with the support of south vietnam and           the supervision of the united nations , but was rejected by the soviet delegation . dim took strong measures to secure south vietnam from perceived internal threats , especially from the viet cong . he eliminated all private militias from the bnh xuyn party and the cao i and ha ho religious sects . in october 1955 , he deposed bo i and proclaimed himself president of the newly established the republic of vietnam , after rigging a referendum . he repressed political opposition , arresting the famous writer nguyn tng tam , who committed suicide while awaiting trial in jail . dim also acted aggressively to remove communist agents still remaining in the south . he formed the cn lao nhn v party , mixing individualist philosophy with republican and capitalist elements , as well as being anti-communist and pro-catholic . another controversial policy was the strategic hamlet program , which aimed to build fortified villages to remove and lock out communists . however , it was in some ways ineffective as many covert communists were already part of the population and visually indistinguishable . it became unpopular as it           of life . in north vietnam during the 1950s , political opposition groups were suppressed ; those publicly opposing the government were imprisoned in hard labor camps . prisoners were abused and beaten atop of labor-intensive work forced upon them . many died of exhaustion , starvation , illness , or assault by prison guards . many middle-class , intellectual northerners had been lured into speaking out against ho s communist regime , and most of them were later imprisoned in gulags , or executed , known as the nhn vngiai phm affair . the government launched a land reform program , which , according to steven rosefielde , was aimed at exterminating class enemies . victims were chosen in an arbitrary manner , following a quota of four to five percent . torture was used on a wide scale , so much so that by 1956 ho chi minh became concerned , and had it banned . to 172,000 people perished in the campaigns against wealthy farmers and landowners . rosefielde discusses much higher estimates that range from 200,000 to 900,000           members . a northern democratic literary movement called nhn vn-giai phm occurred , in which it attempted to encourage the democratization of the north and the free expression of thought . intellectuals were thus lured into criticizing the leadership so they could be arrested later , many of whom were sent to hard labor camps , following the model of mao tse-tung s hundred flowers campaign in china . freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and other basic civilian freedoms were soon revoked after the government s attempt of destroying the literary movement . a puritan personality cult was also established around ho chi minh , later extended nationwide after the communist reunification of the vietnam , and is reminiscent to other communist nations like north korea , and the soviet union . in 1960 , at the third party congress of the vietnamese communist party , ostensibly renamed the labor party since 1951 , l dun arrived from the south and strongly advocated the use of revolutionary warfare to           establish communism nationwide . despite some elements in the party opposing the use of force , l dun won the seat of first secretary of the party . as h ch minh was aging , l dun virtually took the helm of war from him . the first step of his war plan was coordinating a rural uprising in the south and forming the viet cong or national front for the liberation of south vietnam toward the end of 1960 . the figurehead leader of the viet cong was nguyn hu th , a south vietnamese lawyer , but the true leadership was the communist party hierarchy in south vietnam . arms , supplies , and troops came from north vietnam into south vietnam via a system of trails , named the ho chi minh trail , that branched into laos and cambodia before entering south vietnam . at first , most foreign aid for north vietnam came from china , as l dun distanced vietnam from the revisionist policy of the soviet union under nikita khrushchev . however , under leonid brezhnev ,           provided north vietnam with heavy weapons , such as t-54 tanks , artillery , mig fighter planes , surface-to-air missiles etc . meanwhile , in south vietnam , although ng nh dim personally was respected for his nationalism , political stability and policies triggering rapid economic growth , he ran a nepotistic and authoritarian government . elections were routinely rigged and dim favored of minority roman catholics on many issues , believing that catholics were more trustworthy , more anti-communist and more impermeable to viet cong infiltration . his religious policies sparked protests from the buddhist community after demonstrators were killed on vesak , buddha s birthday , in 1963 when they were protesting a ban on the buddhist flag . this incident sparked mass protests calling for religious equality . the most famous case was of venerable thch qung c , who burned himself to death to protest . the images of this event made worldwide headlines and brought extreme embarrassment for dim . the tension was not resolved , and on august 21 , the arvn special forces loyal to his brother and chief adviser ng nh nhu and           country , leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds . in the united states , the kennedy administration became worried that the problems of dim s government were undermining the us s anti-communist effort in southeast asia , and of dim s increasing resistance and non-cooperation with the american government . on november 1 , 1963 , with the planning and backing of the cia and the kennedy administration , south vietnamese generals led by dng vn minh engineered a coup d  tat and overthrew ng nh dim , killing both him and his brother nhu. between 1963 and 1965 , south vietnam was extremely unstable as no government could keep power for long . there were more coups , often more than one every year . the communist-run viet cong expanded their operation and scored some significant military victories during this period . in 1965 , us president lyndon johnson sent troops to south vietnam to secure the country and started to bomb north vietnam , assuming that if south vietnam fell to the communists           in accordance with the domino theory . other us allies , such as australia , new zealand , south korea , thailand , the philippines , and taiwan also sent troops to south vietnam . although the american-led troops succeeded in containing the advance of communist forces , the presence of foreign troops , the widespread bombing over all of vietnam , and the social vices that mushroomed around us bases upset the sense of national pride among many vietnamese , north and south , causing some to become sympathetic to north vietnam and the viet cong . in 1965 , air marshal nguyn cao k and general nguyn vn thiu took power in a coup , and presided over a stable junta , and promised to hold elections under us pressure . in 1967 , south vietnam managed to conduct a national assembly and presidential election with lt. general nguyn vn thiu being elected to the presidency , bringing the government to some level of stability . however , in 1968 , the viet cong launched a massive and surprise tt offensive , attacking almost all major cities in south vietnam over the vietnamese new year . the viet cong and north vietnamese captured the city of hu , after which many mass graves were found . many of the executed victims had relations with the south vietnamese government or the us , or part of social groups that were considered enemies to the viet cong , like catholics , business owners and intellectuals . over the course of the year the viet cong forces were pushed out of all cities in south vietnam and nearly decimated . in subsequent major offensives in later years , north vietnamese regulars with artillery and tanks took over the fighting . in the months following the tet offensive , an american unit massacred civilian villagers , suspected to be sheltering viet cong guerillas , in the hamlet of my lai in central vietnam , causing an uproar in protest around the world . in 1969 , h ch minh died , leaving wishes that his body be           for public display and built the ho chi minh mausoleum on ba nh square in h ni , in the style of lenin s mausoleum in moscow . although the tt offensive was a catastrophic military defeat for the vit cng , it was a stunning political victory as it led many americans to view the war as unwinnable . u.s. president richard nixon entered office with a pledge to end the war with honor . he normalized us relations with china in 1972 and entered into dtente with the ussr . nixon thus forged a new strategy to deal with the communist bloc , taking advantage of the rift between china and the soviet union . a costly war in vietnam begun to appear less effective for the cause of communist containment . nixon proposed vietnamization of the war , with south vietnamese troops taking charge of the fighting , yet still receiving american aid and , if necessary , air and naval support . the new strategy started to show some effects : in 1970 , troops from the army of the republic of vietnam successfully           campaign ) ; in 1971 , the arvn made an incursion into southern laos to cut off the ho chi minh trail in operation lam son 719 , but the operation failed as most high positions captured by arvn forces were recaptured by north vietnamese artillery ; in 1972 , the arvn successfully held the town of an lc against massive attacks from north vietnamese regulars and recaptured the town of qung tr near the demilitarised zone in the center of the country during the easter offensive . at the same time , nixon was pressing both hanoi and saigon to sign the paris peace agreement of 1973 , for american military forces to withdraw from vietnam . the pressure on hanoi materialized with the christmas bombings in 1972 . in south vietnam , nguyn vn thiu vocally opposed any accord with the communists , but was threatened with withdrawal of american aid . despite the peace treaty , the north violated the treaty and continued the war as had been envisioned by l dun and the south still tried to recapture lost territories . in the u.s.           was seen as losing a strong backer . under u.s. president gerald ford , the democratic-controlled congress became less willing to provide military support to south vietnam . in 1974 , south vietnam also fought and lost the battle of hong sa , in defending the islands against the invading chinese over the control of the paracel islands in the south china sea . neither north vietnam nor the u.s. were involved . in early 1975 , north vietnamese military led by general vn tin dng launched a massive attack against the central highland province of bun m thut . south vietnamese troops had anticipated attack against the neighboring province of pleiku , and were caught off guard . president nguyn vn thiu ordered the moving of all troops from the central highland to the coastal areas , as with shrinking american aid , south vietnamese forces could not afford to spread too thin . however , due to lack of experience and logistics for such a large troop movement in such a short time , the whole south vietnamese 2nd corps got bogged down on narrow mountain roads , flooded           ambushes along the way . the south vietnamese first corps near the dmz was cut off , received conflicting orders from saigon on whether to fight or to retreat , and eventually collapsed . many civilians tried to flee to saigon via land , air , and sea routes , suffering massive casualties along the way . in early april 1975 , south vietnam set up a last-ditch defense line at xun lc , under commander l minh o . north vietnamese troops failed to penetrate the line and had to make a detour , which the south vietnamese failed to stop due to lack of troops . president nguyn vn thiu resigned . power fell to dng vn minh . dng vn minh had led the coup against dim in 1963 . by the mid-1970s , he had leaned toward the third party , south vietnamese elites who favored dialogues and cooperation with the north . communist infiltrators in the south tried to work out political deals to let dng vn minh ascend to the presidency , with the hope that he would prevent           although many south vietnamese units were ready to defend saigon , and the arvn 4th corps was still intact in the mekong delta , dng vn minh ordered a surrender on april 30 , 1975 , sparing saigon from destruction . nevertheless , the reputation of the north vietnamese army towards perceived traitors preceded them , and hundreds of thousands of south vietnamese fled the country by all means : airplanes , helicopters , ships , fishing boats , and barges . most were picked up by the u.s. seventh fleet in the south china sea or landed in thailand . the seaborne refugees came to be known as boat people . in a famous case , a south vietnamese pilot , with his wife and children aboard a small cessna plane , landed safely without a tailhook on the aircraft carrier . this mass exodus of vietnamese political refugees continued into the 1980s as refugees fled from persecution , political oppression and economic collapse caused by the new communist regime . during this period , north vietnam was a communist state with a centralized command economy           the proletariat , a powerful propaganda machine that effectively rallied the people for the party s causes , a superb intelligence system that infiltrated south vietnam , and a severe suppression of political opposition . even some decorated veterans and famed communist cadres , such as trn c tho , nguyn hu ang , trn dn , hong minh chnh , were persecuted during the late 1950s nhn vn giai phm events and the 1960s trial against the anti-party revisionists for speaking their opinions . nevertheless , this iron grip , together with consistent support from the soviet union and china , gave north vietnam a militaristic advantage over south vietnam . north vietnamese leadership also had a steely determination to fight , even when facing massive casualties and destruction at their end . the young north vietnamese were idealistically and innocently patriotic , ready to give the ultimate sacrifice for the liberation of the south and the unification of the motherland .  socialist republic . rummel estimates that slave labor in the new economic zones caused 50,000 deaths . the number of vietnamese boat people who died is estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 , out of the 2.5 million that fled . there were also tens of thousands of suicides after the north vietnamese take-over . in 1988 , vietnam suffered a famine that afflicted millions . many north vietnamese soldiers and cadres began to realize that they had been indoctrinated into thinking that the south vietnamese people were utterly poor and exploited by the imperialists and foreign capitalists who treated them like slaves , shackling , whipping and terrorizing them with dogs . contradictory to what they were taught , they saw an abundance of food and consumer goods , fashionable clothes , plenty of books and music ; things that were           expressed by dng thu hng , a former northern viet cong fighter turned democracy activist and book author , who wrote of this in her book paradise of the blind . in 1976 , vietnam was officially unified and renamed socialist republic of vietnam , with its capital in h ni . the vietnamese communist party dropped its front name labor party and changed the title of first secretary , a term used by china , to general secretary , used by the soviet union , with l dun as general secretary . the viet cong was dissolved . the party emphasized development of heavy industry and collectivization of agriculture . over the next few years , private enterprises were seized by the government and their owners were often sent to the new economic zones -- a communist euphemism for a thick jungle -- to clear land . the farmers were coerced into state-controlled cooperatives . transportation of food and goods between provinces was deemed illegal except by the government . within a short period of time , vietnam was hit with severe shortage of food and basic           area , was threatened with famine . during the mid-1980s , inflation reached triple figures . in foreign relations , the srvn became increasingly aligned with the soviet union by joining the council for mutual economic assistance , and signing a friendship pact , which was in fact a military alliance , with the soviet union . tension between vietnam and china mounted along with china s rivalry with the soviet union and conflict erupted with cambodia , china s ally . vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the u.s. and its allies . the srvn government implemented a stalinist dictatorship of the proletariat in the south as they did in the north . the network of security apparatus controlled every aspect of people s life . censorship was strict and ultra-conservative , with most pre-1975 works in the fields of music , art , and literature being banned . all religions had to be re-organized into state-controlled churches . any negative comments toward the party , the government ,           the person the tag of phn ng , with consequences ranging from being harassed by police , expelled from school or workplace , to being sent to prison . nevertheless , the communist authority failed to suppress the black market , where food , consumer goods , and banned literature could be bought at high prices . the security apparatus also failed to stop a nationwide clandestine network of people trying to escape the country . in many cases , the security officers of some whole districts were bribed and even got involved in organizing the escape schemes . these living conditions resulted in an exodus of over a million vietnamese secretly escaping the country either by sea or overland through cambodia . for the people fleeing by sea , their wooden boats were often not seaworthy , were packed with people like sardines , and lacked sufficient food and water . many were caught or shot at by the vietnamese coast guards , many perished at sea due to boats sinking , capsizing in storms , starvation and thirst . another major threat were the pirates in           , and murdered the boat people . in many cases , they massacred the whole boat . sometimes the women were raped for days before being sold into prostitution . the people who crossed cambodia faced equal dangers with mine fields , and the khmer rouge and khmer serei guerillas , who also robbed , raped , and killed the refugees . some were successful in fleeing the region and landed in numbers in malaysia , indonesia , the philippines , and hong kong , only to wind up in united nations refugee camps . some famous camps were bidong in malaysia , galang in indonesia , bataan in the philippines and songkla in thailand . some managed to travel as far as northern australia in crowded , open boats . all foreign missionaries were expelled from vietnam , including the most famous salesian priest , servant of god andrej majcen from yugoslavia too ; he however remained great friend of vietnamese peoples during whole life . while most refugees were resettled to other countries within five years , others languished in these camps           who could not find asylum were deported back to vietnam . communities of vietnamese refugees arrived in the us , canada , australia , france , west germany , and the uk . the refugees often sent relief packages packed with necessities , such as medicines and sanitary goods to their relatives in vietnam to help them survive . very few would send money as it would be exchanged far below market rates by the vietnamese government . despite the defeat of south vietnam , there was no serious demobilization of the vietnamese people s army , which remained one of asia s largest militaries at over one million troops , or sign that warfare was coming to an end anytime soon . not only were vietnamese soldiers highly experienced from decades of fighting , but also had acquired a large cache of captured us and south vietnamese armaments . vietnam soon found itself drawn into conflict with cambodia , which had been ruled by the communist khmer rouge since 1975 . in addition to this , sino-vietnamese relations deteriorated quite rapidly following mao zedong s death in 1976 due to           was at odds with china during the 1970s . by 1978 , most trade and material assistance programs between the two countries had ceased and vietnam forbade chinese ships from docking at its ports . as the khmer rogue were allies of beijing , this further aggravated tensions and following border skirmishes , the vpa launched a full-scale armed invasion of cambodia during the first week of 1979 . given the extreme brutality and mass murders committed by the khmer rouge , the international community could only consider the vietnamese invasion a positive development . this had the effect however of causing conflict with china and during a visit to the us in february , deng xiaoping stated that it may be necessary to teach vietnam a lesson . a large chinese force invaded the vietnamese border area , but with china still suffering the effects of the cultural revolution , the people s liberation army was seriously deficient in training , equipment , and communications . over 30,000 chinese troops were killed or wounded in three weeks of           then in cambodia and had no involvement in the war ) . shortly afterwards , they withdrew with beijing proclaiming that the aforementioned lesson had been taught as in any case , the fighting caused extensive destruction to vietnam s infrastructure along the border . the pro-vietnamese people s republic of kampuchea was created with heng samrin as chairman . the vietnamese invasion of cambodia had stopped the genocide of millions of cambodians by the khmer rouge . pol pot s khmer rouge allied with non-communist guerilla forces led by norodom sihanouk and son sann to fight against the vietnamese forces and the new phnom penh regime . some high-ranking officials of the heng samrin regime in the early 1980s resisted vietnamese control , resulting in a purge that removed pen sovan , prime minister and general secretary of the kampuchean people s revolutionary party . the war lasted until 1989 when vietnam withdrew its troops and handed the administration of cambodia to the united nations . vietnam s third constitution , based on that of the ussr , was written in 1980 . the communist party was stated by the           and to lead the country . in 1980 , cosmonaut phm tun became the first vietnamese and the first asian to go into space , traveling on the soviet soyuz 37 to service the salyut 6 space station . during the early 1980s , a number of overseas vietnamese organizations were created with the aim of overthrowing the vietnamese communist government through armed struggle . most groups attempted to infiltrate vietnam but eventually were eliminated by vietnamese security and armed forces . overall , the first decade after reunification was not a happy time for the country . nonstop warfare consumed large amounts of vietnam s resources , both financially and by depleting the labor force of young men . the country remained internationally isolated , having little contact with nations outside comecon members , and faced with a huge , hostile neighbor to the north . despite repeated overtures to the united states , attempts to reestablish diplomatic relation were hampered by the question of missing us soldiers from the war and president ronald reagan s vocal hostility towards the country s principle benefactor in moscow . in a 1981           dong remarked yes , we defeated the united states , but now we are a poor undeveloped nation and barely have enough to eat . hence the saying that waging war is easy , but running a country is hard . compounding all this was the complete failure of the five year plan adopted in 1976 , as vietnam remained one of the world s poorest countries with a per-capita gdp of less than 300 usd and almost totally dependent on soviet aid , which reached as much as 3 billion usd a year by 1982 . moscow faced mounting pressure from its warsaw pact allies to reduce outlays to vietnam . soviet-vietnamese relations were also harmed by the former s wishes to have greater involvement in vietnam s economic development and increased access to military facilities . in 1982 , the vcp held its 5th national congress in which general secretary le duan stated that the party wishes sternly to criticize itself . and our nation s manifold difficulties , while aggravated by outside circumstances that could not be helped , are nonetheless worsened by the various errors and shortcoming           average age of the party leadership , noting that there was only one person on the central committee under 60 . that year , a general purge of the party ranks began to weed out elderly and inefficient cadres and replace them with younger men . vo van kiet , aged 59 , was promoted to head of the state planning commission , and 62-year old foreign minister nguyen co thach was elevated to politburo membership . more surprising was the removal of general vo nguyen giap , considered a national hero , from the politburo this rejuvenation campaign was nonetheless diminished by the fact that the country s three most powerful individuals , le duan , pham van dong , and president truong chinh , showed no sign of stepping down any time soon despite their combined age of 226 and clearly failing health . although they saw the need for reforms and fighting corruption , such change was beyond their ability by this point           and showed a clear move towards more market reforms and away from the rigid central planning of the 1976-80 scheme . real change would not begin until the second half of the decade when le duan passed away in july 1986 , succeeded as general secretary by trng chinh . however , trng was expelled only five months later and replaced by nguyen van linh , eight years his junior . pham van dong retired as premier in 1987 . upon their accession , the country s new leadership denounced their geriatric predecessors for utterly failing to improve the people s living standards , check corruption , or instill a more flexible , non-dogmatic outlook on life . during the late 80s , vietnam began tentative market reforms along the model then being adopted by china . the basis for these experiments were in the south which had a stronger tradition of trade and commerce . the perestroika policies of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev were also a source of motivation . although communist governments in eastern europe were collapsing in 1989 , vietnam was kept comparatively isolated from these events due           pro-democracy protests in hanoi were quickly suppressed . the fall of the soviet union in 1991 caused a thaw in the long hostile sino-vietnamese relations as the two nations embraced each other as some of the only surviving communist states . soon after the paris agreement on cambodia resolved the conflict in october 1991 , however , vietnam established or reestablished diplomatic and economic relations with most of western europe , and several asian countries . in february 1994 , the united states lifted its economic embargo against vietnam , and in june 1995 , the united states and vietnam normalized relations . in june 2005 , a high-level vietnamese delegation , led by prime minister phan vn khi , visited the united states and met with their u.s. counterparts , including president george w. bush . this was the first such visit in 30 years . although the visit mostly went well , a few embarrassing events occurred such as the white house s official website accidentally depicted the flag of south vietnam in its official announcement of the visit . this provoked dismay and hostile comments           and corrected the webpage . in addition , a crowd of hostile protesters gathered outside the white house during phan s meeting with president bush denouncing the vietnamese communist party and waving south vietnamese flags . in late 2005 , a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing vietnam . this triumvirate consisted of the vcp general secretary , the prime minister , and the president . general secretary manh headed up not only the vcp but also the 15-member politburo . president luong was chief of state , and prime minister khai was head of government . the leadership was promoting a socialist-oriented market economy and friendly relations with the european union , russia , and the united states . although the leadership was presiding over a period of rapid economic growth , official corruption and a widening gap between urban wealth and rural poverty remained stubborn problems that were eroding the vcp s           summit and became the 150th member state of wto on 11 january 2007 , after concluding bilateral agreements with the united states , australia , new zealand , mexico , and the dominican republic in order to qualify for membership . in the summer of 2011 , spontaneous mass demonstrations erupted in hanoi and saigon , where thousands of vietnamese protested china s increasing military aggression and encroachment into vietnamese waters and territories in the south china sea . the authorities moved in to break up the protests after an official complaint was lodged by the chinese embassy in hanoi , as the vcp s official policy since the 1990s has been one of good relations with beijing and there was no desire on their part to disrupt the status quo . in 2013 , a baby girl named nguyen thi thuy dung was born and was chosen as vietnam s official 90th million citizen .

time = 03:00 aft the kandahar massacre , more precisely identified as the panjwai massacre , occurred in the early hours of march 11 , 2012 , when united states army staff sergeant robert bales murdered sixteen civilians and wounded six others in the panjwayi district of kandahar province , afghanistan . nine of his victims were children , and eleven of the dead were from the same family . some of the corpses were partially burned . bales was taken into custody later that morning when he told authorities , i did it . on august 23 , 2013 , a jury at joint base lewis-mcchord in fort lewis , washington sentenced him to life in prison without parole . american and international security assistance force authorities apologized for the deaths . afghan authorities condemned the act , describing it as intentional murder . the national assembly of afghanistan passed a resolution demanding a public trial in afghanistan , but then-u.s . secretary of defense leon panetta said the soldier would be tried under u.s. military law . bales pleaded guilty on 5 june           the prosecution not seeking the death penalty . at the time of the plea , he stated that he did not know why he committed the murders . united states authorities concluded that the killings were the act of a single individual . on 15 march 2012 , an afghan parliamentary probe team made up of several members of the national assembly of afghanistan had speculated that up to 20 american soldiers were involved in the killings . the team later said they could not confirm claims that multiple soldiers took part in the killings .  background   the  surge  in southern afghanistan  panjwai is the birthplace of the taliban movement and has traditionally been a stronghold of theirs . it has been an area of heavy fighting and was the focus of a military surge in 2010 , which brought a more than two-fold increase in airstrikes , night raids into afghan homes , insurgent casualties , and a six-fold increase in special forces operations throughout afghanistan . fighting in panjwai and adjacent zhari , arghandab and kandahar districts was particularly intense . conflict between           wholesale destruction of some villages by american forces , mass arrests , murder of civilians by rogue units , and high casualties from improvised explosive devices . one of the families targeted in the kandahar shootings had returned to the area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge . fearing the taliban but encouraged by the u.s. government , the army , and the afghan government , they settled near the american military base because they thought it would to be a safe place to live . approximately three weeks before the incidents , u.s.afghan relations were strained by an incident where copies of the quran were burnt at the bagram air base . a couple of months before the shootings , u.s. marines were videotaped urinating on dead taliban fighters .  allegations of issues at fort lewis  the shooter , robert bales , was based at joint base lewis-mcchord . the primary medical treatment facility at the base , madigan army medical center , has come under investigation for downgrading diagnoses of soldiers with ptsd to lesser ailments . military           did not give returning troops sufficient time to recover before sending them on further deployments , and that the base s medical unit is understaffed and overwhelmed by the numbers of returning veterans with deployment-related medical and psychological trauma . in april 2011 , a jblm soldier killed his wife and 5-year-old son before killing himself . in january 2012 , a jblm soldier murdered a mount rainier national park ranger . in two separate incidents , unrelated jblm soldiers have been charged with waterboarding their children . jorge gonzalez , executive director of a veterans resource center near fort lewis , said that the kandahar killings offer more proof that the base is dysfunctional : this was not a rogue soldier . jblm is a rogue base , with a severe leadership problem , he said in a statement . base officials responded , saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not reflect on the work and dedication of all service members . robert h. scales , a retired u.s. army major general and former commandant of the army war college , suggested that           infantry personnel in the last ten years for close combat in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere .  8 march roadside bombing  residents of mokhoyan , a village about 500 metres east of camp belamby , stated that a bomb had exploded in their vicinity on 8 march , destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several u.s. soldiers . they recounted that u.s. soldiers afterwards lined many of the male villagers against a wall , threatening to get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people , and threatening that you and your children will pay for this . one mokhoyan resident told   the associated press   it looked like they were going to shoot us , and i was very afraid . american officials from the pentagon declared that they had no evidence that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in mokhoyan . u.s. officials refused to confirm or deny that american soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 march . bales  lawyer , john henry browne , later stated that his client was upset           explosion on 9 march . it is unclear whether the bombing cited by browne was the same as the one described by the villagers .  incident   killings  according to official reports , bales left combat outpost camp belamby at 3:00 a.m. local time wearing night vision goggles . bales was wearing traditional afghan clothing over his isaf fatigues . according to government officials with knowledge of the investigation , the killings were carried out in 2 phases , with bales returning to base in between . an afghan guard reported a soldier returning to base at 1:30 am , and another guard reported a soldier leaving at 2:30 am . bales is believed to have first gone to alkozai , about 1/2 mile north of camp belambay , then to najiban , located 1 1/2 miles south of the base . four people were killed and six wounded in alkozai , and 12 people were killed in najiban . american sentries at the base heard gunshots in alkozai , but did not take action besides attempting to view alkozai from           u.s. authorities recognized 16 people killed , including nine children , four men , and three women . on 22 march that number was revised to 17 , but later reduced back to 16 . it was initially reported that five others were injured , and that number was eventually increased to six . four members of the same family were killed in alkozai . according to a 16-year-old boy who was shot in the leg , bales woke up his family members before shooting them . another witness said she saw the man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit her head against a wall . the first victim in najiban appears to have been mohammad dawood . according to dawood s brother , bales shot dawood in the head , but spared dawood s wife and six children after the wife screamed at him . eleven members of abdul samad s family were killed in a house in najiban village , including his wife , four girls between the ages of 2 and 6 , four boys between 8 and 12 , and two other relatives           by their hair and shot them in the mouth . at least three of the child victims were killed by a single shot to the head of each . their bodies were then set on fire . then another civilian , mohammad dawoud , age 55 , was killed in another house in this village . witnesses reported that bales was wearing a headlamp and/or a spotlight attached to his weapon . bales burned some of the victims  bodies , an act considered desecration under islamic law . witnesses said that the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head , stabbed , then gathered into one room and set on fire . a pile of ashes was found on the floor of one victims  house ; at least one child s body was found partially charred . a reporter for   the new york times   inspected the children s bodies taken to a nearby american military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads .  surrender and confession  following the events at alkozai and balandi , bales           him leaving his outpost before the killings and u.s. commanders on base assembled their troops for a head count when it was discovered that the soldier was missing . a patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier , but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings . he was reportedly taken into custody without incident . there were no military operations being conducted in the area at the time of the shootings . the surveillance video from the base reportedly shows the soldier walking up to his base covered in a traditional afghan shawl . the soldier removes the shawl and lays his weapon on the ground , then raises his arms in surrender . the video has not been released to the public . american investigators suspect that bales may have departed the base before midnight , committed the murders in balandi , then returned to the base around 1:30 a.m . bales may have then departed the base at 2:30 a.m. and committed the murders in alkozai . it was apparently the second departure which caused the alert and the commencement of the           defense officials , upon his return to the base bales said three words : i did it and then told individuals what happened . later he retained a lawyer and refused to speak further with investigators . the united states flew bales out of afghanistan to kuwait on 14 march 2012 , then to the united states disciplinary barracks at fort leavenworth in kansas on 16 march . a pentagon spokesman said the move was done because of a legal recommendation .  the number of assailants  according to u.s. authorities , a single soldier staff sergeant robert bales conducted the attack . the u.s. military showed afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video at the base as proof that there was only one perpetrator of the shootings . according to reuters , some neighbors and relatives of the dead saw a group of u.s. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m. , enter homes and open fire . they were all drunk and shooting all over the place , said neighbor agha lala . according to   the new york times   , one           villagers described seeing a number of soldiers , while some other afghan residents described seeing only one gunman . one mother-of-six , whose husband was killed during the incident , reported involvement of a large number of people : when they shot dead my husband , i tried to drag him into the house .. i saw more than 20 people when i looked out the house . the americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me , telling me not to leave the house or they d kill me . an eight-year-old girl named noorbinak , whose father was killed reported that one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard , holding lights . the brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen numerous soldiers with headlamps and lighted guns . some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned , claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help . in response , afghan president hamid karzai appointed general sher mohammad karimi to investigate the claims . on 15 march 2012 , an           the national assembly of afghanistan announced that up to 20 american soldiers were involved in the killings , with support from two helicopters . they had spent two days in the province on site , interviewing the survivors and collecting evidence . one of the members of the probe team , hamizai lali , said : we closely examined the site of the incident , talked to the families who lost their beloved ones , the injured people and tribal elders .. the villages are one and a half kilometre from the american military base . we are convinced that one soldier can not kill so many people in two villages within one hour .. the victims have been killed by the two groups . lali asked the afghan government , the united nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in afghanistan . while visiting one of the affected villages , hamid karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said : in his family , in four rooms people were killed children and women were killed and then they were all brought together in one room           can not do . however , the team later said they could not confirm that multiple soldiers took part in the killings .  financial payments to victims  families  on 25 march 2012 at the office of the governor of kandahar province , the united states gave the equivalent of us$860,000 to the victims  families , allocated as $50,000 for each person killed and $10,000 for each person injured . the official who disbursed payments to the families said the money was not compensation , but rather the u.s. government s offering to help the victims and their families . a member of the kandahar provincial council described the payments as assistance , but not as the kind of legal compensation that would absolve the accused .  robert bales  the army alleged that robert bales , a 38-year-old united states army staff sergeant stationed at camp belambay , was the only person responsible for the shootings . according to defense secretary leon panetta , immediately after being captured , bales acknowledged the killings and told individuals what happened . he then asked for an attorney and           to officials , bales may have been having marital problems , and the investigation of the shootings is looking into the possibility that an e-mail about marriage problems might have provoked bales . his wife wrote on her blog about her disappointment after he was passed over for a promotion to sergeant first class . the family was also struggling with finances , and three days before the shootings bales  wife put their home up for sale , as they had fallen behind with mortgage payments . on march 23 , 2012 , the u.s. government charged bales with 17 counts of murder , six counts of attempted murder , and six counts of assault . on march 24 , 2012 , american investigators said they believe bales split the killings in the villages of balandi and alkozai into two attacks , returning to camp belamby after the first attack before slipping out again an hour later . no other u.s. military personnel were disciplined for having any role in the incident . on august 22 , 2013 , bales pled guilty at his general court-martial ,           as an act of cowardice . the plea spared bales from the death penalty . on august 23 , 2013 , bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole by the court . he was also demoted to private , the lowest possible rank , dishonorably discharged , and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances . a commanding general overseeing the court-martial has the option of reducing the sentence to life with the possibility of parole . afghan villagers and the families of bales  victims were upset by the decision saying he deserved death . abdul samad , a 60-year old farmer who lost 11 family members , eight of whom were children , spoke about the incident : i do nt know why they killed them . our government told us to come back to the village , and then they let the americans kill us . one grieving mother , holding a dead baby in her arms , said , they killed a child , was this child the taliban ? believe me , i have nt seen a 2-year-old member of the           i do nt want money , i do nt want a trip to mecca , i do nt want a house . i want nothing . but what i absolutely want is the punishment of the americans . this is my demand , my demand , my demand and my demand , said one villager , whose brother was killed . more than 300 panjwai locals gathered around the military base to protest the killings . some brought burned blankets to represent those killed . in one house , an elderly woman screamed : may god kill the only son of karzai , so he feels what we feel . on 13 march , hundreds of university students protested in afghanistan s eastern city of jalalabad , shouting death to america death to obama and burning effigies of the u.s. president and a christian cross . on 15 march about 2,000 people took part in another protest , in the southern province of zabul.  reaction from afghan authorities  the president of afghanistan , hamid karzai , called the incident intentional murder and stated this was an assassination , an           . he said the united states must now pull back its troops from village areas and allow afghan security forces to take the lead in an effort to reduce civilian deaths . on 16 march karzai said the u.s. was not fully co-operating with a probe into the killings . he also said the problem of civilian casualties at the hands of nato forces has been going on for too long .. it is by all means the end of the rope here . a spokesperson for the afghan interior ministry condemned the act in the strongest possible terms . afghan politicians wanted bales to face an afghan court . the national assembly of afghanistan insisted that the u.s. soldier be put on public trial in afghanistan : we seriously demand and expect that the government of the united states punish the culprits and try them in a public trial before the people of afghanistan . it also condemned the killings as brutal and inhuman and declared that people are running out of patience over the ignorance of foreign forces . abdul rahim ayobi , a member of parliament from kandahar           the american soldiers are out of the control of their generals . kamal safai , a member from kunduz , said that while it was the act of a single man , the public reaction will blame the government of america , not the soldier .  reaction from u.s. and nato  american and isaf forces apologized and promised a full investigation , with secretary of defense leon panetta stating that the soldier will be brought to justice and be held accountable and that the death penalty could be a consideration . u.s. president barack obama called the incident absolutely tragic and heartbreaking but noted that he was proud generally of what u.s. troops have accomplished in afghanistan . obama said the incident did not represent the exceptional character of the american military and the respect that the united states had for the people of afghanistan . on 13 march , he said , the united states takes this as seriously as if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered . were heartbroken over the loss of innocent life . the killing of innocent civilians           reporter asking whether the killings could be likened to the 1968 my lai massacre of civilians by u.s. forces in south vietnam , obama replied , it s not comparable . it appeared you had a lone gunman who acted on his own . general john r. allen , commander of the isaf , issued an apology as well . adrian bradshaw , the deputy commander of the nato forces in afghanistan , apologized i wish to convey my profound regrets and dismay .. i can not explain the motivation behind such callous acts , but they were in no way part of authorised isaf military activity . a rapid and thorough inquiry was promised . u.s. officials said the killings would not affect their strategies in the area .  reaction from the taliban  the taliban said in a statement on its website that sick-minded american savages committed the blood-soaked and inhumane crime . the militant group promised the families of the victims that it would take revenge for every single martyr . the taliban also accused afghan security officials of being complicit in the attack . the militant           deadly rampage . on 13 march , the taliban launched an attack on an afghan government delegation which was visiting the site of the killings , killing one government soldier and injuring three .  see also  * list of massacres in afghanistan * war in afghanistan * khosrow sofla * maywand district

in vibrational spectroscopy , an overtone band is the spectral band that occurs in a vibrational spectrum of a molecule when the molecule makes a transition from the ground state to the second excited state , where v is the vibrational quantum number that one gets after solving the schrdinger equation for the molecule under consideration . it takes only non-negative integer values . generally , in order to study the vibrational spectra of molecules , the vibration of the chemical bonds is assumed to be simple harmonic.thus the parabolic simple harmonic potential is used in the schrdinger equation to solve for the vibrational energy eigenstates . when the schrdinger equation is solved one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates . these energy states are found to be quantised , meaning they can assume only some discrete values of energy . when electromagnetic radiation is shined on a sample of a molecule , the molecules can absorb energy from the electromagnetic radiation and change their vibrational energy state . however , the molecules can absorb energy from radiation only           in the electric dipole moment of the molecule when it is vibrating . this change in the electric dipole moment of the molecule leads to the transition dipole moment of the molecule , for transition from the lower to higher energy state , being non-zero which is an essential condition for any transition to take place in the vibrational state of the molecule , as is the law of nature , explained thoroughly in quantum mechanics . it has been found that , when the bonds are considered vibrating simple-harmonically , the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for the transition where v=1 . hence ; for the ideal , non-existent , simple-harmonically vibrating bond ; there can never be any overtone observed in the vibrational spectrum . but , real molecules do not vibrate simple-harmonically . the potential function vibration is not parabolic , simple-harmonic potential , but is better approximated by the morse potential . when schrdinger equation is solved for the molecule under consideration with morse potential as the potential function , one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates with           corresponding to transitions from various energy levels to various other energy levels , the transition dipole moment does not become zero for the transitions where v=2 , 3 , 4 , etc . thus , for real molecules , the allowed transitions are those for which v=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . the overtone band observed in the ir spectrum is one such transition with v=2 , from v=0 to v=2 energy state . however it has been experimentally found that the intensity of the overtone band is very low compared to the fundamental band .

henry nugent bell was an irish genealogist .  biography  he was the eldest son of george bell , esq. , of belleview , county fermanagh . he followed the profession of a legal antiquary , and , in order to obtain a recognised status , entered himself at the inner temple , 17 nov. 1818 . in the same year he acquired considerable distinction by his successful advocacy of the claim of mr. hastings to the long-dormant earldom of huntingdon ; the estates , however , with the exception , it is said , of a mill in yorkshire , had died from the title , and were legally invested in the earl of moira s family . bell published a detailed account of the proceedings in   the huntingdon peerage   , 4to , london , 1820 , pp. 413 , and the narrative of his various adventures , which are given at length , displays a suspicious luxuriance of imagination not altogether in keeping with what professed to be a grave genealogical treatise           affixed in 1821 , with a genealogical table and additional portraits . bell was also employed by mr. j. l. crawford to further his claim to the titles and estates of crawford and lindsay , and , if we may credit the common report , received no less a sum than 5,036/. for prosecuting the suit . he was cut off before he could bring the matter to a decisive issue , and dying in- solvent , the unfortunate claimant s money was in a great measure lost . according to lady anne hamilton , bell , with other minions , was delegated by lord sidmouth in 1819 to incite the starving people of manchester against the ministry , and by their means the meeting of 16 aug. was convoked which led to the peterloo massacre . the circumstances attending his death as narrated in the journals of the day were somewhat tragic . an action to recover a sum of money advanced to him by an engraver named cooke was tried on 18 oct. 1822 , and a verdict passed against him ; on the same evening he died .

issn = 0163-7266   railroad &amp; railroad   was the first magazine title created in-house by carstens publications . based in newton , new jersey , the magazine is produced monthly , edited by steve barry . as a magazine dedicated to trains and rail transportation , it stands out from its main competitor   trains   as a publication focused on the enthusiast and related activities . it is also the successor to railroad magazine , purchased by carstens in 1979 , and listed separately on the masthead to this day .  founding and early days  as early as 1968 , future   railroad model craftsman   editor tony koester visited publisher harold carstens to pitch an idea for a railfan s magazine , at the insitance of his friend jim boyd . at the time , carstens cited the lack of potential advertisers and stiff competition from the long-established   trains   and   railroad   magazines as a reason for not           initial meeting , carstens did make an offer to koester to join the staff of rmc . with this rapid modernization , many historic pieces of vintage railroad equipment were scrapped , though a great many more were saved , thanks to the rise in railfan activity and the development and support of the railway preservation movement . by the mid-1970s , preparations were underway to celebrate the nation s bicentennial , and with it came a renewed interest in railroad heritage , namely the return of several steam locomotives to main line excursion service . amidst all of this change ,   railfan &amp; railroad   not only reported on these activities , but also encouraged them and the railfan culture . response to the new magazine was favorable , and   railfan   went to a bi-monthly schedule starting with the august 1977 issue . part of the success of the new magazine has been attributed to boyd s skill as a photographer and writer , as well as his real-world railroading experience and his personality . upon the purchase of the defunct              railfan &amp; railroad   starting with the may 1979 issue . the masthead of current issues continues to list the publication serials of both titles individually . incremental changes to update the look and feel of the magazine began in 2010 , when a new logo debuted to replace an earlier redeisgn dating from 1999 . at the end of 2010 , editor emeritus jim boyd suffered a heart attack and died near his home in newton . in 2011 , otto vondrak joined the staff as associate editor after working as a contractor and freelancer for the previous year . since its beginning , the editorial style of the magazine tends to be focused on the active enthusiast who is more likely to be engaged in the hobby by taking photographs of current railroad operations , visiting museums and tourist lines , and contributing to historical preservation activities . topics range from the historic to the contemporary , and includes news photos and monthly columns to balance out the feature content . the magazine continues its focus on the railroad enthusiast , thanks in part to editor steve           his enthusiasm for photography . the majority of content is contributed by the readers of the magazine , with the editors appearing as-needed . in december 2011 ,   railfan &amp;

railroad   in 1979 . the column was later renamed transit currents and is now edited by prof. george m. smerk , and covers commuter rail , rapid transit , and light rail , as well as selected historic trolley operations . markers - this column is complied by the editors to discuss items that do nt normally fit the rest of the magazine , and occasionally features guest authors .  see also  * railroad-related periodicals  notes

  green v lord somerleyton   2003 ewca civ 198 is an english land law case , concerning easements.  facts  green had dykes . water from lord someleytons land drained into the dykes , and green brought an action in nuisance to stop it happening after a serious flood that came from a lake on somerleytons property . water had flowed from it through marshland . the trustees of lord somerleytons land counterclaimed that they had an easement for the water drainage , from a 1921 conveyance by implied reservation . judge held there was no remedy in nuisance for naturally flowing water under   leakey v national trust   1980 qb 485.  judgment  jonathan parker lj held that nuisance could cover floodwater . but green had not made clear what action they ought to take , nor had he taken action to reduce risk himself . furthermore , the provisions in the drainage deed were incorporated by reference into the conveyance to green , and by implication those drainage rights were intended to be proprietary . so somerleyton did           for the purpose of draining the said lands i.e. scale marshes and priory marshes and effectually drain the same .  116 . it also imposed obligations on the purchaser , mr mallett , to keep the dykes on priory marshes cleansed and open and in proper order . 117 . given the terms of the 1921 drainage deed , and their express incorporation by reference into the 1921 conveyance , the conclusion seems to me to be inescapable that the 1921 conveyance impliedly reserved to lord somerleyton and his successors in title to scale marshes an easement of drainage through the existing dykes in the terms claimed by the trustees .
in computer programming , package principles are a way of organizing classes in larger systems to make them more organized and manageable . they help us understand which classes should go into which packages called package cohesion and how these packages should relate with one another called package coupling . package principles also includes software package metrics , which help us quantify the dependency structure we design , thereby giving us different or more precise insights into the overall structure of our classes and packages .  overview   principles of package cohesion  1 . reuse-release equivalence principle : rep essentially means that the package must be created with reusable classes either all of the classes inside the package are reusable , or none of them are . the classes must also be of the same family . we do nt want to include classes that are unrelated to the purpose of the package . if we construct a package as a family of reusable classes , we can more closely guarantee a focused , reusable package . 2 . common-reuse principle : ccp states that the package should not have more than one reason to change . if change were to happen in an application dependent on a number of packages , ideally we only want changes to occur in one package , rather than in a number of them . : this helps us determine classes that are likely to change and package them together for the same reasons . if the classes are tightly coupled , put them in the same package .  principles of package coupling  1 . acyclic dependencies principle : in a development cycle with multiple developers , cooperation and integration needs to happen           can be no cycles in the dependency structure , and that when an incremental release is made , the other developers can adopt and build upon it . 2 . stable-dependencies principle : designs , by nature of the environments they are used in or by , are changing . so we need to design our packages to be able to change as well . the sdp states that any packages we want to be volatile should not be depended on by a package that is difficult to change . 3 . stable-abstractions principle : the sap says that a stable package should also be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended . it also states that an instable package should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed .

  inocybe salicis   is an uncommon species of fungus found in association with willow in europe . the species produces small , brown or yellow mushrooms with caps up to 2.5cm 1 across , with stems up to 3.5 cm long . the species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus   inocybe   that also associate with willow , and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically.  taxonomy and phylogeny    inocybe salicis   was described and named by robert khner in 1955 in the   bulletin trimestriel de la socit mycologique de france   .   inocybe straminipes   is a synonym of   i. salicis   . the former was originally described in 1979 by henri romagnesi , and had different spores from those of   i. salicis   . however , the holotype was reexamined in 2009 by ukka vauras and katri kokkonen , who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of   i. salicis             . the specific epithet   salicis   is in reference to   salix   , the generic name for willow . within the genus   inocybe   ,   i. salicis   belongs to the section   marginatae   , which also includes   i. obtusiuscula   ,   i. dunensis   ,   i. salicis-herbaceae   ,   i. substellata   ,   i. praetervisa   ,   i. saliceticola   and   i. mixtilis   . these species are all known to associate with willow , and all have macroscopic similarities . as such , they are best differentiated microscopically.  description    inocybe salicis   mushrooms have tawny to yellowish-brown caps of between 1and2.5cm in in diameter . their surface can be cracked , covered in fibres or scaly . the caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature ; while younger specimens have campanulate to conical caps , the caps of older specimens expand and flatten ,           a cutis . the gills are almost free , meaning that they only just connect to the stem , and are initially a pale grey , becoming an ochre-grey as they age . the stem has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules . the stem is 1.5to3.5cm in long by 0.4to1cm in thick . there is a well-defined bulb at the base of the stem . the white flesh smells spermatic , but the scent is not distinctive .  microscopic characteristics    inocybe salicis   produces spores of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8 micrometers . in shape , they are elongated or curved , but they are covered with 10 to 15 distinctive blunt , semi-circular projections . the cystidia on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25 m with a cell wall 2 to 3 m thick , and either taper at each end , or are shaped like swollen bottles , with the cheilocystidia more variable .           ) are club- or balloon-shaped , and caulocystidia can be found all the way down the stem .  distribution and habitat    inocybe salicis   favours wet land in willow woodland and clearings . although widespread throughout its range in europe , it is not commonly encountered .

recorded = 200712 in malibu ; **6;84408;br the boat studio , silverlake ; **6;84416;br south beach studios , miami and motorbass studio , paris label = matador   sun   is the ninth studio album by american musician cat power . her first album of all-original material since 2006 s   the greatest   , it was released on september 3 , 2012 , in the united kingdom and in the united states on september 4 , 2012 , via matador records . the album was issued in a variety of formats , including a limited edition deluxe lp containing a 7 vinyl of bonus tracks . the album s lead single , ruin , was released for free download at matador record s store on june 20 , 2012 . a music video for album opener cherokee , directed by marshall , has recently been released , while an ambient remix of the song by nicolas jaar is available to download from cat power s official website . the song was premired on npr s   all songs considered   on           as going in yet another direction . a lot more drive , a lot more electronics , drum machines , synthsit s very bold . on april 10 , 2013 , cat power performed the previously unreleased track bully on the premier episode of the forty-second series of later .. with jools holland . immediately following the broadcast , a new version of the album containing bully as a bonus track was made available for download through itunes.  background and recording  work on the album initially began soon after the release of   the greatest   , with marshall announcing the album s title as far back as 2006 in an interview with   the new york times   , where she also claimed that the entire album had already been written . marshall decided to finance the recording of   sun   herself , following financial difficulties arising from the cancellation of a lengthy tour in 2006 due to her hospitalisation . she was later declared bankrupt , claiming i had my house in foreclosure and i had nt paid taxes in           guessing me and wondering what i was going to do with the advance for this album , i said ,  i m going to fucking pay for this shit myself .  i knew that d be the only way i could control things . so i cashed out my retirement fund . recording began sometime in 2007 , with marshall building a studio in her malibu home to record and produce new songs herself . however , much of the material recorded up to this point was later abandoned when marshall decided it was too painful and personal to put out , stating i was writing all these really slow guitar songs , and my friend said ,  this is like depressing old cat power ,  which made me feel like i got shot . i did nt work for eight months after that . progress on the album was delayed again with the recording and release of her second covers album   jukebox   in 2008 , and later by her relationship with giovanni ribisi . following the tour in support of             studio in silverlake , california , where she began work on newly written , electronic material , with marshall claiming , i had no fucking idea what to do , but i knew i was not going to even look at a piano or touch a guitar . so i started out with a weird synthesizer . eventually i had these skeletons of songs , but then i felt like a failure because i thought ,  this is not fucking good , i do nt know what i m doing .  and i did nt know what i was doing . i had lyrics and a beat and notes , but i did nt have anything else . it sounded like a naked , shivering alien . this period of inactivity placed a strain on marshall s relationship with her label matador who , concerned by the lack of progress , began pressuring marshall to work with a producer . marshallwho had nt worked with a producer since ed douglas recorded both   dear sir   and   myra lee   on the same day           need a producer is like telling someone that they need a nose job . it activates something in you that makes you feel like a loser . it was around this time that marshall regrouped at her home in malibu with members of her backing band , the dirty delta blues , to start preparation for a tour in the beginning of 2011 . rehearsing many of the skeletal new compositions she had written , the band would go on to perform ten previously unreleased songs over the course of the tour ; including cherokee , ruin , real life and human being , as well as another six that would later be excluded from the album bully , brave liar , horizon , let me go , monster and woman of my word . hoping to rerecord these songs with the band following completion of the tour , these sessions , according to marshall , did nt work out the way she hoped , noting that ruin is the only song on the album to feature contributions from the dirty delta blues band . production for the album continued at           the instrumentation from the aborted dirty blues band sessions . after hearing a song from the beastie boys album   hot sauce committee part two   on the radio , she contacted that album s mixer , cassius member philippe zdar , in the hope of a potential collaboration . unable to pay zdar for his mixing work until the album was finalised and presented to matador for release , she transferred her work to zdar s recording studio in francewhere he worked pro bonountil sessions for the album finally concluded in april 2012.  critical reception  the album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release . at metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 44 reviews , which indicates generally favorable reviews . allmusic editor heather phares , in a very positive review , commented that the album s remarkably spare production aesthetic sounds all the more striking coming after   the greatest s lushness and said that marshall s willingness and ability           sounds is nt such a far cry from the more sonically adventurous moments on   moon pix   and especially   you are free   ; she s just expanding on that instinct and adding a more hopeful songwriting bent .   magnet   commented that this is easily her fullest-sounding , most animated record to date , awarding the album 4 stars out of 5 . similarly , drowned in sound reviewer hayley avron referred to   sun   as the most rounded and accomplished album of cat power s career , elaborating that it seemed that she may have reached a creative peak with   the greatest   , which signified a definitive leap in her musical evolution . that wheel kept on turning though , and   sun   marks an even bolder step forward ; the songs sound light and layered with space and sound and is rich with an air of experimentation , with none of the pitfalls of amateurism that often accompany such forays into musical exploration .   rolling stone            one of the most emotionally intense songwriters around , but with   sun   she has made her riskiest , most vital album , not to mention one of her greatest . melissa maerz of entertainment weekly stated that marshall has never sounded more confident or in control than she does on   sun   , awarding the album a grade of a. james skinner of bbc music gave the album a positive review , noting that if there is nothing here as instantly transfixing as some of her past work ,   sun   comes alive on closer listening , revealing myriad depths and unexpected vocal turns . consequence of sound editor sarah grant called   sun   a passionate pop album of electronic music filtered through a singer-songwriter s soul , while   the fly   reviewer sophie thomsett said that the album has transformation and catharsis seeping through every note , before summarising that at its peak ,   sun   reaches greatness , specifically with both manhattan and the 11-minute opus  nothin  but           best material she s ever penned , with both writers awarding the album 4.5 out of 5 stars . stephen deusner of   paste   said that the album was absolutely fascinating in its humanity and compassion , awarding the album 8.0 out of 10 . matthew foster of the quietus , in a positive review , said that   sun   is about as cathartic as pop gets and described the album as the light at the end of one hell of a tunnel , a record brimming with an assurance and playfulness . anna wilson of   clash   rated it six out of ten and said the album was a robust , respectable detour , but will leave some fans pining for the smoky chanteuse of old . andy gill of   the independent   commented on marshall s change in musical direction , saying that she abandoned her soul charm for something much less appealing , while claiming that the overdubbing process turns tracks like nothin  but time into trudges , awarding the album 3 stars out of           austin trunick said that the album is nt likely to land among the singer-songwriter s best records , but it s clear , however , that her heart went into it , rating the album 3 out of 5.  accolades  the album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications .   rolling stone   magazine , in their list of the 50 best albums of 2012 , ranked it at sixteenth place , writing the idea of the brilliantly morose chan marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd . yet the groove-powered   sun   is a perfect fit . the a.v. club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the best albums of 2012 . billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the 10 best albums of 2012 .   the l.a. times   and   filter   magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012 .   sun   was also included on two separate           at number five on the list compiled by bob boilen , while topping the list compiled by robin hilton . the album was also listed twenty-eighth on stereogum s list of top 50 albums of 2012.  commercial performance    sun   entered the   billboard   200 chart at number ten with sales of over 23,000 copies , becoming her first top ten album in the us , which also made it the first album released in matador records  twenty-three year history to reach the   billboard   200 top ten . the album also debuted at no. 2 on   billboard s alternative albums and indie albums charts .  track listing  * *  personnel  credits adapted from allmusic and   sun   album liner notes . ;

the concept of the malay world or malay realm has multiple meanings depending on its context . linguistically , it refers to the malay-speaking countries and territories of southeast asia - brunei , indonesia , malaysia , singapore , and southern thailand . in a geopolitical context , the term has been used interchangeably with the javanese concept of nusantara and the colonial term for the malay archipelago . it has been more broadly defined as a region , homeland of the austronesian people that extends from the easter islands in the east to madagascar in the west , . however , these wider definitions of the malay world remained controversial and criticized for their primary derivation from the anachronistic concept of a malay race . in a cultural sense , the malay world refers to the homeland of ethnic malays that was historically ruled by various malay sultanates in maritime southeast asia . this area includes the malay peninsula , the coastal areas of sumatra and           origin  portuguese historian emanuel godinho de erdia s 16th century account says the early phase of the malay world began with the consolidation of   laut melayu   under melakan dominance in the 15th century . the area erdia called the malayos sea covers the andaman sea in the north , the entire malacca strait in the centre , a part of sunda strait in the south and the western south china sea in the east . the region was generally described as a muslim centre of international trade , with malay language as its   lingua franca   . erdia s description indicates that   laut melayu   was a **25;60416;toolong concept , a concept of geographical unity characterized by the common religious belief and cultural features . this was strongly attested when the notion of malayness and the common malay identity based on islam began taking shape during the melakan era . the subsequent expansion of melakan commercial and religious influence beyond this cultural border had resulted in the early stage of malayisation process , heavily marked by           customs . this assimilation process continued and intensified even after the demise of melaka in the early 16th century . the post melakan era saw the rise of numerous melakan-modelled malay sultanates in a larger geographical sphere of the region , ranging from the small sultanates like asahan , deli , langkat and serdang , to the powerful imperial sultanates like brunei , johor and pattani . the emergence of these sultanates resulted in a broader malay cultural and commercial influence and the eventual expansion of the malay world . the strong malay cultural and linguistic diffusion in the region as observed by the european scholars during colonial era , would later became the basis for the construction of several anthropological , geographical and linguistic terms . among the examples are the concept of malay race , the name malay archipelago for the region , and several linguistic terminologies such as malayo-polynesian languages and malayic languages . these xenisms have been very influential in shaping various modern views on the extent of the malay world .  see also  * maphilindo * nusantara

in molecular biology , the psbz is a protein domain , which is low in molecular weight . it is a transmembrane protein and therefore is located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in cyanobacteria and plants . more specifically , it is located in photosystem ii and in the light-harvesting complex ii . ycf9 acts as a structural linker , that stabilises the psii-lhcii supercomplexes . moreover , the supercomplex fails to form in psbz-deficient mutants , providing further evidence to suggest ycf9 s role as a structural linker . this may be caused by a marked decrease in two lhcii antenna proteins , cp26 and cp29 , found in psbz-deficient mutants , which result in structural changes , as well as functional modifications in psii.  function  psii is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing polypeptides bound to the photosynthetic membrane . within the core of the complex , the chlorophyll and beta-carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins cp43 and cp47 , which pass the excitation energy on           ) and d2 that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process . the psii oxygen-evolving complex oxidises water to provide protons for use by psi , and consists of oee1 , oee2 and oee3 . the remaining subunits in psii are of low molecular weight , and are involved in psii assembly , stabilisation , dimerisation , and photo-protection . psbz may also be involved in photo-protective processes under sub-optimal growth conditions .  photosynthesis  oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae . photosystem ii has a p680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll  a  that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation of water molecules , and to produce atp via a proton pump . photosystem i has a p700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated           both atp and nadph are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by psii , releasing oxygen as a by-product .

4 : forward unto dawn   is an american military science fiction action film set in the universe of the   halo   franchise . a coming-of-age story ,   forward unto dawn   follows a cadet , thomas lasky , at a twenty-sixth century military training academy as it is attacked by the covenant , an alliance of alien zealots . lasky is unsure of his future within the military but feels pressured to follow in the footsteps of his mother and brother . lasky and his surviving squad mates are rescued by the master chief and , after the death of his romantic interest , chyler silva , lasky is inspired by the chief to take initiative and aids him in saving the remaining cadets .   forward unto dawn   received a streamy award and several           producing and filming of it . the series also won a motion picture sound editors golden reel award for sound editing . reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act , but found that the plot was too slow in the first half and most of the characters were under-developed . the series was also nominated for a primetime emmy award for main title design .  development  after the success of previous live-action promotional shorts ,   landfall   and   the life   , 343 industries , the studio in charge of development for the   halo   franchise , wanted to use a live action series to appeal to an audience of people unfamiliar with the   halo   games . the director of franchise business management at 343 industries , matt mcclosky , explained the intended audience by saying that , you see something that looks like a video game , you re going to get the same crowd you always get . the live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop           thomas lasky to the   halo   universe before his role in the video game   halo 4   . the developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than master chief , to not only convey an understanding of the universe , but to better engage unfamiliar viewers . microsoft considers the series the next step between advertising material and a full length film after the failure of a previous effort , and aimed to produce a standalone series that could be enjoyed without necessarily playing the games . the budget for the series was almost usd $10 million , microsoft s largest investment in a live-action promotion . director stewart hendler said we re either the best-funded web series of all time , a sort of mid-road healthy tv pilot , or a super-low-budget movie . when the idea of directing a video game based web series was pitched to hendler he declined , saying he was not interested in video game adaptions unless the subject was   halo   . hendler was already a fan of           games . potential writers were interviewed by 343 industries , and some were selected to write a draft of a script . aaron and todd helbing wrote a pitch set on harvest , the first planet to be attacked by the covenant . although 343 industries decided not to use it , the helbing brothers  script was the most complete and demonstrated the best understanding of the   halo   universe so they were chosen to write   forward unto dawn   . the final plot was developed by 343 industries , frank oconnor , and the helbings with the intention of introducing a new character to tie-in to   halo 4   , which their harvest script did not , and to explore the least-well-known part of the   halo   universe . in addition to providing input on the script , 343 industries had a representative on set at all times to ensure that the series did not break canon .  shooting and special effects  the series           forests around vancouver , at simon fraser university and at additional stages in burnaby . the herzog and company production team was in vancouver for three months with set design by legacy effects , the same company that worked on the previous shorts . the warthog that appears in   forward unto dawn   is the same one that was produced by weta workshop and used in   landfall   . stunt driver johnathon kralt found that the prop handles the roads extremely well for something that size and that height , and the four-wheel steering was an advantage for drifting . many chase shots were made using a mercedes-benz ml 55 pursuit vehicle with a camera boom mounted to the roof . another rig involved towing the warthog on a low trailer so that cameras could focus on an actor while the vehicle was being driven . the visual effects supervisor , john sullivan , hired arc productions to create just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery , between a quarter and a third of           appear are all completely computer generated , as is the academy s space elevator , weapons  muzzle flashes and a few shots of master chief . hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the master chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production . one scene involves a covenant elite stalking the cadets in the armoury . the geometry of the elite already exists for the   halo   video games and was used to accelerate the creation of a 3d model in mental ray . the outdoor attack on the academy was filmed at simon fraser university and required photogrammetric reconstruction and laser measurement to add the aliens and weapons lighting effects in a convincing manner . a later scene in the forest was too complex to use the same techniques , lacking the geometric shapes of the university campus . instead , arc visual effects supervisor terry bradley scattered leds on the set . by measuring the distance between leds the studio could model the area           add the weapons fire . the shattering of the pink needles fired by the covenant was rendered in houdini as the shots hit concrete and master chief s armour . the opening sequences of each episode show cortana , an artificial intelligence , aboard the spaceship   forward unto dawn   as she malfunctions . the five sequences were entirely computer generated by polynoid , the animation team of blacklist , a production company .  setting    forward unto dawn   takes place on a fictional planet , cirnicus-iv , one of many that humans have colonized outside of the solar system . the protagonist , thomas lasky , is aboard a spaceship named   infinity   in 2557 .   forward unto dawn   portrays his memory of the events on circninus-iv in 2526 , when he is a cadet at the corbulo academy , a training facility for the children of high-ranking unsc officers . the unsc is training the cadets for war with insurrectionists on various colony planets . a covenant army attacks the academy causing confusion and           unto dawn   , the covenant are a theocratic collection of alien species that are religiously offended by humanity and seek to eradicate it . the events portrayed in   forward unto dawn   are some of the earliest encounters with the covenant , and the characters other than master chief were unaware of their existence .  casting and characters  the production team was responsible for casting , but microsoft maintained a final say . the decision to use alex puccinelli instead of steve downes , the previous voice artist of master chief , was approved by microsoft . the actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes . cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training , causing some to vomit , which they saw as a bonding experience . tom green plays the protagonist thomas lasky , a cadet at corbulo academy and ty olsson plays the adult rendition . lasky is ambivalent about his role in the military , considering diplomacy a better           ; his mother is a colonel and his brother cadmon was an odst , but thomas is uninterested in becoming an officer . green portrayed lasky as a regular teenager , unsure of his future . as research for the role , green was required to watch the previous shorts and read the   halo   encyclopedia that 343 industries uses to preserve the   halo   canon . executive producer josh feldman considers lasky an important character in the   halo   universe beyond just   forward unto dawn   and   halo 4   . daniel cudmore was cast to play the role of master chief largely due to his height and physique . the director , stewart hendler , wanted to contrast the size of master chief to that of the teenage cadets ; cudmore is 203 centimetres tall whereas the actors playing the cadets were deliberately chosen           accurately portray master chief , cudmore watched the   landfall   shorts by neill blomkamp and read the   halo   novels for the history of the character , having already played the games . cudmore expressed interest in the history of master chief , the character s view on war and his role as a soldier , as he was only required to portray a utilitarian character in the series . cudmore thinks the character is torn between aiding the cadets and completing his mission , but master chief s confidence and actions inspire the cadets . legacy effects took a body scan of cudmore , then overlaid a 3d model provided by microsoft and edited it to get proportions correct . a prototype was 3d printed and then used to make moulds for the final suit . the majority of the suit is rubber over a foam bodysuit , similar to a wetsuit , with a fibreglass helmet . cudmore compared wearing it to walking through water , although he had to perform stunts in the suit as it was made only for his body           after they were shot to ensure that they were deliberate but without appearing robotic , trying to make his movements a little larger than life , but still with a sense of humanity to them . both hendler and frank oconnor praised cudmore , not just for his physique but for moving in a fluid manner in the cumbersome suit . anna popplewell plays chyler silva , a cadet who , contrary to lasky s beliefs , is a full supporter of the war against the insurrectionists . popplewell portrays silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence . she had a romantic connection with lasky that was interrupted by the covenant attack . popplewell was new to the   halo   series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience . other characters include cadets april orenski , a senior cadet and squad leader , played by enisha brewster , junjie chen , played by osric chau , who is the only cadet without           through his own achievements , dimah tchakova played by kat de lieva , walter vickers played by iain belcher and michael sullivan , played by masam holden .  episodes   release  on april 30 , 2012 , microsoft studios announced that   forward unto dawn   would play on machinima prime and halo waypoint during the weeks leading up to the release of   halo 4   . the series  first episode attracted five million views on youtube within two weeks and , as of march 2013 , has eleven million views . the second episode attracted three million views within two weeks and six million views by march 2013 ; however , these statistics do not include views on halo waypoint . the series consists of five 15-minute shorts , the first released on october 5 , 2012 , with subsequent episodes released weekly . a 90-minute extended version is included with the

released a model of the unsc spaceship ,   forward unto dawn   . the model is approximately one metre long and has scenes from both the video game and the web series .  critical reaction  reviewers were divided on what standard to           ; the budget was beyond that of other web series but not on par with a film . ign reviewer jesse schedeen considered the cadets other than lasky and silva to be ready-made cannon fodder , having received minimal development . this detracted from the quality of the third episode , as a betrayal by cadet tchakova had little impact due to her shallow development . however , schedeen did appreciate green s acting in the last episode , noting that silva s death scene was handled very well , particularly as it forced tom green to shed his calm exterior and react much more emotionally . in his later review of the blu-ray , schedeen complimented the audio and video quality , as well as the inclusion of many vignettes , documentary featurettes and commentaries . james plath of   movie metropolis   also found the characters lacking in the first half , but noted that in the second half , the characters of lasky and silva actually move beyond the clichs and pick up a personality along the way . plath was impressed by the soundtrack ,           complimented the special effects saying the cgi work is enhanced by high definition , not exposed by it . overall however , he thought that despite the action being exciting , the pedestrian first-half and only adequate acting would prevent   forward unto dawn   appealing to an audience beyond existing gamers .   official xbox magazine   s reviewer , edwin evans , appreciated the direction of the series ; stewart hendler s well-judged editing keeps the script from sinking under the weight of its own melodrama , and his close-ups never overstay their welcome , hiding the weaknesses of the inexperienced cast . he also echoed plath s thoughts on the slow first-half and exciting second half .  awards and nominations

gridref = nw4111830995 divis transmitting station is the main high-power uhf and bbc national fm/dab station that serves county antrim and parts of county down . situated just outside belfast , it is the primary uhf/fm main station in northern ireland and was originally northern ireland s main bbc 405-line television transmitter , coming into operation in this capacity on 21 july 1955 . as such , it was the first permanent television transmitter to be established within the island of ireland . although one of three uhf main stations in northern ireland , it is the only one to feature a stayed mast , the other stations at brougher mountain and limavady both utilising smaller self-supporting towers . stayed masts are however located at the uhf relay stations at londonderry and strabane and at black mountain , the former ita 405-line main station and current transmitter of channel 5 that is sited adjacent to divis . it is owned and operated by arqiva . the divis station is located in a range of hills directly overlooking belfast from           was controlled by the ministry of defence , until it was sold in 2004 to the national trust and subsequently opened to the public . it is sited between the peaks of divis mountain and black mountain and is ironically closer to the latter than the transmitter that is named after it .  television history  divis was opened by the bbc on 21 july 1955 as their permanent 405-line band i transmission facility serving northern ireland . it superseded the temporary station at glencairn , which was one of two transmitters to be rushed into operation on 1 may 1953 , in time for the televised coronation of queen elizabeth ii . although the bbc had by this time already obtained the divis site , the need to construct the long access road was the primary factor preventing its immediate use for a provisional installation . divis was designated as a medium-power transmitter , on which type of installation the second phase of bbc band i stations were based . in this respect , divis was grouped with permanent installations at meldrum           sandale and tacolneston . transmissions from divis were on vhf channel 1 at a peak output of 35 kw vision e.r.p . in due course , a number of relay stations were established across northern ireland to enhance coverage from divis , most notably at brougher mountain in county fermanagh , the latter being the site of a future uhf main station . in the meantime , the independent television authority built their equivalent 405-line vhf band iii station close to divis . located at black mountain quarry , less than two miles to the south-west , this came into operation on 31 october 1959 and utilised a taller 750-ft mast . divis however became the uhf main station for belfast and surrounding area with bbc2 the first regular service commencing 18 march 1967 . colour uhf transmitters for bbc1 and itv came into operation in september 1970 . both this site and black mountain are perhaps not surprisingly dual ring-fenced for enhanced security . it has since been made public that the current transmitter mast           new guyed steel mast . this meant for a period of time there were two broadcast masts at the site in preparation for the digital switchover in the ulster region which occurred in october 2012 . whilst this was certainly one of the plans , in reality a new 152m guyed mast has been constructed , and the original mast remains to carry the vhf and dab services . by way of its extensive transmitter bases , divis contributes significantly to the telecommunications network for much of northern ireland .  services available   digital television  digital television services broadcast on the following frequencies , and with the following powers :  before switchover   analogue television  analogue television services were broadcast on the following frequencies : all of the above channels , except tg4 , were broadcast at a power of 500 kw . as well as providing direct reception for most tv viewers in northern ireland , all the other analogue transmitters in the province source their output , either directly or indirectly , from divis . tg4 , a channel           , was broadcast at a very low power and not relayed to any other transmitters . channel 5 was broadcast from the nearby black mountain transmitting station .  analogue radio  fm radio service broadcast on the following frequencies and with the following powers :  digital radio  dab radio broadcasts on the following frequency :

lady carla was a british thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the epsom oaks in 1996 . in a racing career which lasted from october 1995 to july 1997 the filly ran six times and won three races . after winning her only race as a two-year-old , lady carly won the listed oaks trial stakes at lingfield park on her three-year-old debut . four weeks later she maintained her unbeaten run in the classic oaks over one and a half miles at epsom , winning by nine lengths . she was beaten when favourite for the irish oaks and finished unplaced in two races the following season before being retired to stud.  background  lady carla was a bay mare with a white star , bred by the meon valley stud in hampshire , england . her sire , caerleon , won the prix du jockey club and the benson &amp; hedges gold cup in 1983 and went on to become an excellent stallion , siring the winners of more than 700 races including generous , cape verdi           shirley superstar , won one minor race and produced no other important winners , but was a daughter of the nassau stakes runner-up odeon . as a descendant of the french broodmare democratie , she was related to the oaks winners juliette marny and scintillate as well as the st leger winner julio mariner , the nunthorpe stakes winner matatina and the middle park stakes winner showdown . as a yearling , lady carla was sent to the tattersalls september sales at newmarket , where she was bought for 220,000 guineas by wafic said s addison racing ltd . lady carla was sent into training with henry cecil at his warren place stables at newmarket . she was ridden to all her wins by the veteran irish jockey pat eddery.  racing career  lady carla did not appear on a racecourse in 1995 until late october , when she was sent to contest a 4,000 maiden race at leicester racecourse . she started the 5/2 second favourite in a field of twelve runners and won by four lengths from the colt general macarthur . six and a half months after           a three-year-old in the oaks trial stakes over eleven and a half furlongs at lingfield park . she started 4/11 favourite against three opponents and led from the start to win by three and a half lengths from flame valley and moody s cat . the field for the 1996 epsom oaks was not a strong one , with the rockfel stakes winner bint salsabil being the only one of the eleven fillies to have won at group race level . the best filly of the season , bosra sham , was rested during the summer after winning the 1000 guineas . lady carla was made 100/30 second favourite behind pricket , the representative of sheikh mohammed s godolphin organisation . pricket had been trained by henry cecil before until sheikh mohammed had withdrawn all his horses from the warren place stable the previous autumn . pat eddery positioned lady carla among the leaders from the start and turned into the straight in second place behind moody s cat . two furlongs from the finish , lady carla took the lead           lengths from pricket , with mezzogiorno half a length back in third . the winning distance was the fourth longest of the century , after those of sun princess , noblesse and jet ski lady . only five fillies appeared to oppose lady carla in the irish oaks at the curragh in july , and she started at odds of 1/2 to maintain her unbeaten record . the build-up to the race was marked by controversy , with cecil angrily denying claims from the television pundit john mccririck that the filly had developed a serious respiratory condition . in the race , eddery attempted to lead from the start , but when lady carla was challenged in the straight she failed to respond and was soon beaten . she finished fourth behind the dermot weld-trained dance design , beaten by four and a half lengths . lady carla returned as a four-year-old in 1997 , and made her first appearance for eleven months in the hardwicke stakes at royal ascot . ridden by           among the leaders until half way , but then weakened to finish ninth of the ten runners behind predappio . in july , lady carla was ridden by willie ryan in the princess of wales s stakes at newmarket , fallon having lost the mount after a questionable ride on bosra sham in the eclipse stakes . she was struggling half a mile from the finish and came home last of the seven runners in a race won by shantou.  assessment and honours  the independent timeform organisation gave lady carla a rating of 122 . in their book   a century of champions   , based on the timeform rating system , john randall and tony morris rated lady carla an inferior winner of the oaks .  stud record  lady carla was retired to become a broodmare based at the kiltinan stud in county tipperary . in december 2003 at tattersalls , the ten-year-old lady carla was auctioned at a dispersal of wafic said s bloodstock , after the syrian businessman decided to give up his interest in horse racing . she was bought for           carla s offspring have not been particularly successful . her best runners have probably been avalon , who won a minor race and finished third in the great voltigeur stakes , and high ruler , who finished fourth in the irish 2000 guineas . another of her sons , indigo magic , has become a successful breeding stallion in south africa .  pedigree

two remixes . the first           trinidadian hip hop artist nicki minaj , whilst the second mix titled bluelight strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded

and hip hop squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of a sample of the drum track from his 1980 s song the big beat . composed on the key of a major , girl on fire uses common time and is           beats per minute . key s vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of c 4 up to a high note of e 5 . on the main single , keys opens the songs with the lyrics she got both feet on the ground and she s burning it down . she got her head in the clouds and she s not backing down . this girl is on fire ! keys  lyrics centre around toasting the achievements of women everywhere , particularly with the hook she s just a girl and she s on fire , which according to mtv s rob markman is delivered with a calming-yet-commanding wail . markman also spoke of the pace of the song , describing it as pulsating .   la time   s gerrick kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook . critics likened girl on fire to keys  previous singles no one and try sleeping with a broken heart . she raps took me           yeah i m in the ghost but i ai nt doing stunts with her/ i ai nt trying to be that , haters want to see that/ but i got  em aggy , cause i win the gold like gabby .  bluelight version  by contrast , the bluelight version features a slower production and re-recorded vocals.  reception   critical response

and try sleeping with a broken heart . agreeing with those comparisons was gerrick kennedy from the   la times   who went on to describe the main single as a sweeping ballad with powerful vocals and an anthemic hook .           inferno remix , minaj s fluid verses and an added thump might make that version of the song get noticed more , while its the bluelight version kennedy called the most intoxicating . on the latter kennedy said it would be unfortunate to overlook due to keys  sensual vocal tone . erin thomposn from   seattle weekly   praised keys  on the song for making the often cheesy girlpower theme seem genuinely stirring and elegant , commenting that only alicia keys could do it . describing the chorus of the song , thompson said it booms with thudding drums as her

yarim-lim i , also given as yarimlim , was the second king of the ancient amorite kingdom of yamhad in modern-day aleppo , syria .  reign   early reign and conflicts  yarim-lim was the son and successor of the first king sumu-epuh and his queen sumunna-abi . the kingdom of yamhad was being threatened by the assyrian king shamshi-adad i who had surrounded yamhad through his alliance with charchemish and urshu to the north , qatna to the south , and conquering mari to the east . yarim-lim ascended the throne after his father was killed in 1780 during his campaigns against shamshi-adad . he was able to stand up to shamshi-adad by surrounding him with deft alliances with hammurabi of babylon and ibal-pi-el ii of eshnunna . his alliance with hammurabi was credited with saving babylon from an assyrian attack by attacking their rear . in 1777 yarim-lim conquered the city of tuttul , on the confluence of the rivers balikh and euphrates . he appointed his ally , zimri-lim , the heir to the throne of mari who was living           shamshi-adad died in 1776 , he helped zimrilim regain his throne in mari and oust yasmah-adad . the alliance between mari and yamhad was cemented with the royal marriage between zimrilim and yarim-lim s daughter shibtu , two days after the marriage ceremony queen sumunna-abi died . ibal-pi-el ii of eshnuna exploited shamshi-adad death to pursuit an expansionist policy , advancing on the account of assyria and causing stress to the alliance , he later allied himself with elam the enemy of hammurabi who was yarim-lim ally .  relations with mari  zimri-lim ascension to the throne with the help of yarim-lim i effected mari status , zimri-lim referred to yarim-lim as his father and acted under the guidance of aleppo main deity hadad of which yarim-lim was the mediator . the tablets of mari recorded many events that revealed zimri-lim subordination . on two occasions zimri-lim demanded the extradition of his subordinates from yarim-lim i , the first case was related to a vassal king of zimri-lim who addressed him as a brother instead of a father and the demand was refused , while the second was through the           some fugitives to which yarim-lim answered with decline twice before agreeing on the mariote ambassador third attempt . at one instance nur-sin the mariote ambassador in aleppo wrote to his master for the handing of an estate called alahtum to hadad , and in another instance , ibal-pi-el offered peace and fixing the borders to zimri-lim who sent envoys to yarim-lim asking for authorization which was nt given , leading zimri-lim to refuse the treaty on three different occasions .  later reign and succession  yarim-lim extended his influence to several other important city-states in syria through alliance and vassalage , including urshu and the rich kingdom of ugarit . the relationship between qatna and yamhad seems to have improved during yarim-lim s reign as well . the armies of aleppo campaigned as far as elam near the modern southern iraqi-iranian boarders , a tablet discovered at mari revealed the extent of those military interventions in mesopotamia , the tablet includes a declaration of war against dr and diniktum in retaliation for their evil deeds , a reminder to the king of dr about the military           the stationing of 500 aleppan warships for twelve years in diniktum . by the time of his death , yarim-lim , had more than twenty kings as vassals and allies . according to historian william j. hamblin he was at the time the mightiest ruler in the near east outside of egypt , he died c. 1764 bc and was succeeded by his son hammurabi i.

dinosporin is a macromolecular , highly resistant organic compound which forms or partly forms , the enclosing wall of fossilizable organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts.  composition  the walls of organic-walled dinocysts are composed of the resistant biopolymer called dinosporin . this organic compound has similarities to sporopollenin , but is unique to dinoflagellates . resistant biopolymers are non-hydrolyzable and fossilizable macromolecular organic compounds present in many microalgal cell walls and fossil palynomorphs . thus far , only the motile stage of   gymnodinium catenatum   has been shown to produce the highly aliphatic biopolymer algaenan . dinosporin has been shown to be a significantly different biopolymer from algaenan , which demonstrates that dinoflagellates are able to produce a completely different biomacromolecule for their resting cysts . previous descriptions of dinosporin having similar properties to sporopollenin were based on both compounds resistance to hydrolysis and high preservation potential . however , further research has instead shown that dinosporin is compositionally distinct . despite the clear distinction between dinosporin and other resistant biopolymer groups , very little is known about the actual structure of dinosporin . a recent            lingulodinium polyedrum   does not contain significant amounts of long chain aliphatics , nor is it primarily aromatic , but that it is a highly crosslinked carbohydrate-based polymer . furthermore , dinosporin may be taxon specific as species within the same genus exhibited different compositions , so that dinosporin may be more accurately thought of as a suite of related but chemically distinguishable biopolymers . studies of dinosporin composition and structure are complicated by the fact that the cysts have to either have the cell contents effectively removed or be individually picked in order to ensure sample purity . the culture-derived cysts risk condensation of the cell content and modification of the cyst wall while the cysts picked from sediment are time consuming to acquire and may have been altered by post-mortem processes . for example , the macromolecular composition of the fossil dinoflagellate cyst   thalassiphora pelagica   was analyzed , but post-mortem alteration was noted . furthermore , dinocysts can be subject to selective preservation . this has been speculated to reflect different dinosporin           no conclusive differences have been shown . recent ftir work shows both differences and similarities between the major dinocyst lineages , which are suggested to be related to nutritional strategies .

stage 10 of the cambrian is the still unnamed third and final stage of the furongian series . it follows the jiangshanian and precedes the ordovician tremadocian stage . the proposed lower boundary is the first appearance of the trilobite   lotagnostus americanus   around million years ago , but other fossils are also being discussed . the upper boundary is defined as the appearance of the conodont   iapetognathus fluctivagus   which marks the beginning of the tremadocian and is radiometrically dated as million years ago .  naming  the 10th stage of the cambrian has not been formally named by the ics yet , although a number of local names exist . several authors favor the name lawsonian after lawson cove , in the wah wah mountains of utah .  stratotype  the ics is still discussing which geological section and biostratigraphic marker will be used to define the base of the 10th cambrian stage . likely candidates for the section are still investigated . a first proposal was a section near duibian , zhejiang province           the house range of utah . if a conodont is used for the base the stage then many more sections would be likely candidates for the gssp , e.g. in australia , kazakhstan and canada . candidates for the biostratigraphic marker are the first appearance of a trilobite or conodont species . the trilobite   lotagnostus americanus   was first suggested by the ics , but has proven to be problematic . in 2006 another working group proposed the first appearance of   cordylodus andresi   . currently the first appearance of   eoconodontus notchpeakensis   is favored by many authors because it is globally widespread and is independent of facies . the   eoconodontus notchpeakensis   proposal would also incorporate a non-biostratigraphic marker to correlate the beginning of stage 10 globally . a carbon isotope excursion occurs in the lower part of the   e. notchpeakensis   range .  subdivisions  cambrian stage 10 can be subdivided using different biostratigraphic zones . several conodont zone and           trilobites.  references

  free dimensional   , released on october 23 , 2012 , is the second album from canadian musician diamond rings . according to oregan , his diamond rings persona exists to sort of smash that kind of tendency that i think we all have to sort of hide behind ourselves . and i think this record s probably , or definitely , my strongest statement that i ve made to date . he also says a big part of this album was becoming more comfortable as a musician and a composer and an arranger , and i felt like i really stepped up as a singer with this album , and im really proud of that . oregan has stated that this album is more polished than   special affections   , but i did nt really change my approach lyrically or emotionally . i feel like theyre still conveying the same message , but just coated in a way that has a few more layers of gloss . its like we spent a two more           heavier dance orientation to his unique recording set-up : i had a sit-down desk and i got rid of it cause i started working all day on these songs and i started feeling really sluggish , like i was a banker or something . so i got rid of the desk , put my computer up , and started recording like that . and it just all has a more dance-ready feel because i was dancing when i was making it ! oregan has compared   special affections   to   free dimensional   : the old album is more introspective , whereas free dimensional seems outrospective . it s got all this energy coming out of it .  track listing

production = 713 last lunch is the thirteenth episode of the seventh season of the american television comedy series   30 rock   , the 138th overall episode , and the second part of the one-hour series finale . it was directed by beth mccarthy-miller and written by tina fey and tracey wigfield . the episode originally aired as an hour-long episode , along with hogcock ! , on the national broadcasting company network in the united states on january 31 , 2013 . guest stars in this episode include marceline hugot , al roker , conan obrien and alice ripley . in the episode , liz lemon returns for the final episode of   tgs   and is thrown into a world of chaos : jack donaghy has quit his job and appears to be on the verge of suicide , tracy jordan is attempting to stop the episode going ahead , because he is due a payout from the network if it does nt , and lutz attempts to extract some genuine emotion from jenna maroney , as she readies her final song for the show . together , hogcock ! and last lunch received near universal acclaim from critics . according to nielsen media research , the episodes were watched by 4.88 million viewers during their original broadcast , becoming   30 rock    s highest-rated episodes for two years . it was nominated for four primetime emmy awards : outstanding directing for a comedy series , outstanding writing for a comedy series , outstanding single-camera picture editing for a comedy series , and outstanding original music and lyrics for rural juror , ultimately winning one for fey and wigfield s writing . it has been listed as one of the greatest series finales in television history by numerous publications .  plot  liz lemon returns for the final episode of   tgs             , who she expects will do anything in his power to stop production going ahead , so that he will get his $30 million payout from the network , and lutz , whose turn it is alphabetically to pick the last lunch the   tgs   writers will share together . meanwhile , jack donaghy is preparing to leave and regrets the way things ended with liz , but his attempts to make it up to her are rejected . tearfully , he appeals to jenna maroney for advice on how to repair the pair s broken friendship , but she warns him that she has never known liz to let a grudge go . finally , network president kenneth parcell wants jenna to pick an emotional musical number that she can perform at the close of the final show . both liz s problems escalate as tracy bribes al roker to run a news report that a snowicane is headed for the city , and lutz decides to           the other writers . meanwhile , jack begins to act more and more strangely , giving away his personal possessions and walking around the   tgs   studio declaring his love and appreciation for everyone . pete theorises that he could be planning to commit suicide , before suggesting that a real man would opt instead to fake his own death , an idea he becomes suspiciously enamored with . liz initially dismisses this , but grows concerned when jack suggests he ll be at the final show in spirit . elsewhere , jenna decides that , following her unsuccessful attempts to make it in dramatic television and movies , she will return to her first love , broadway , and picks the song from her upcoming musical   the rural juror   as her final performance for   tgs   . however , upon hearing it , kenneth is concerned that jenna s performance lacks real emotion , and that she does not genuinely care that the show is ending . in the writers  room , lutz remains five           and choose another lunch picker , proclaiming that ordering blimpie is his revenge on them for having constantly picked on him , unprovoked , for the last seven years . liz overcomes him and locks him in her office , but he escapes through the ceiling panels and lands right on top of their new lunch choice , finally getting his triumphant victory as they concede to order from blimpie . kenneth returns to jenna s dressing room with two removal men in tow and informs her that he needs to take her mirror , because brian williams wants it for his bathroom . suddenly , she breaks down in tears as she realises that   tgs   is over for good , and that she will miss something after all , if only her mirror . as the final broadcast approaches , tracy disappears and grizz and dot com reveal that he is hiding out at dark sensations , the strip club to which he had taken liz when they d first met . she confronts him and he explains           money , but because he has feared saying goodbye to people ever since he was young , and his father went out for cigarettes and never returned . liz confesses that it is possible that they wo nt remain friends after   tgs   , because people naturally drift apart , but that she loves him despite everything he has put her through . tracy appreciates her honesty and agrees to return . at the final recording , jenna tells tracy that she will miss him , and the pair embrace . however , jack is suspiciously absent , and another conversation with pete about faking his own death leads liz to believe that jack is indeed planning to commit suicide . her fears are confirmed when she discovers a video suicide note in his office , and she tracks his phone to the waterfront , where he is preparing to leave on a boat . he explains that he plans to go away to find what makes him happy , and that he only led her to believe he wanted to kill himself because he was afraid that           hold her grudge . he goes on to confess that over the last seven years , she was one thing that consistently made him happy , and the pair acknowledge that they love each other as friends . jack makes off on his boat , but turns around almost immediately and declares that he s found the answer ; the best idea he s ever had : dishwashers you can see into . at   tgs   , tracy thanks the audience for tuning in for the past seven years , as jenna emotionally performs her final song .  epilogue  one year later , pete has faked his own death and started a new life , but is found by his wife ; liz is producing grizz s new sitcom   grizz &amp; herz   , and has taken her children to work ; she has also stayed in touch with tracy , whose father has finally returned from getting cigarettes ; jenna is attempting to steal a tony award from alice ripley ; jack s creation of the see-through dishwasher has led him to           he is still friends with liz . in homage to the   st. elsewhere   finale , an immortal kenneth holds a snow globe containing the rockefeller center , as he hears liz s great-granddaughter s pitch for a show based on the stories liz had told her about working at   tgs   .  reception  the hour-long broadcast of hogcock ! and last lunch was watched by 4.88 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating/5 share in the 1849 demographic . this means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . this represented a season high in total viewers and in the demographic , an increase of two million viewers over the previous season finale and the highest-rated episode of the series , in overall viewers , for two years . when data obtained from dvr viewers who watched the episode within seven days of broadcast was factored in , total viewership for the finale increased by 25 percent , to 6.13 million           percent , to a 2.6 rating . the series finale received acclaim from critics and from fans of the series . alan sepinwall of   hitfix   opined that the finale gave these ridiculous cartoon characters three dimensions for at least a few moments so they could say proper goodbyes to each other , and to us . he elaborated that liz and tracy back at the strip club was a blunt but heartfelt summation of their whole relationship , and jack on the boat giving a long preamble about the true nature of their friendship before saying that he loved liz was a thing of beauty . in conclusion , he wrote that he would miss this show , but this ending felt close to perfect . roth cornet of   ign   gave the episode a masterpiece 10 out of 10 and commented   30 rock   had the rare ability to provide both comedy and earned sentiment . that has never been more true than           back to his roots , his true-love , after a gloriously short-lived soul searching sea adventure : housewares . liz , once and for all , embraces the fact that , yes , you can have it all , but having it all ultimately means truly knowing and accepting yourself , and having the willingness to compromise . and with that , a series that could have been an ingenious bit of comedy , but not much more , became a show about people and relationships that will stay with us well past the final fade to black tonight . pilot viruet of   the a.v. club   awarded the episode an a and singled out two scenes in particular as perfect : the first is liz meeting tracy at the strip club they visited in the pilot and , while admitting that its possible they wont be friends after this , admitting she still does sincerely love him . the second scene is , if sic course , jacks suicide fakeout , which he staged as a way to prove that liz lemon would miss him in the           will be seen in plenty of future sitcoms ... and while its a shame to see it go , its great to see it go out on such a high note . amy amatangelo of   paste   scored the episode a 9.3 out of 10 and opined that its hard to create a series finale that will make every fan happy . but   30 rock   , which is going out still very close to the top of its game , came very close . there was so much to love about the episode : lizs frighteningly spot-on fights with the moms at gothammoms.com . jenna landing in la , seeing the competition , and high-tailing it right back to new york . the show getting in a few last digs at nbc . plenty of grizz and dot com . what appeared to be the shows real crew in the final   tgs   shot . the return of jonathan . tracy spelling out his name for kenneths receptionist ( r as in the pirate noise , a as in the fonzie           cant look in the mirror to confirm that shes crying . sure , i could have done without the lutz demand for blimpies as the last lunch , but i quibble . james poniewozik of   time   commented that in some ways , last weeks episode felt more like a finale , in that it put a period on several stories : liz got her kids ,   tgs   hit the end of its run , jack got kabletown and kenneth became president of nbc . the last hour , on the other hand , was a goodbyein a   30 rock   -ian meta sense , it was like the one more episode that   tgs   itself had to make , because we werent quite ready to stop and added and im glad we got that epilogue , because as neatly as the rest of this shortened final season wrapped up   30 rocks   plotlines , this last hour captured its emotion . tom gliatto of   people   praised the episode as one           added that the characters were full of the sparkling , absurd liveliness that characterized the show at its best throughout seven seasons . he concluded that with its endless supply of shiny , shapely little jokes , the show could feel like a wonderful salad served up without a bowl . you got tired of being showered with lovely microgreens . this time we got the bowl . it was a lovely burnished wood . brian lowry of   variety   was slightly less favourable , commenting the finale earns points for ambition and nostalgia . there are the obligatory celebrity cameos , some very clever lines , a nifty callback to the pilot , and a kicker that exhibits a real love for television a lot of the audience probably wo nt understand it . but the whole thing is a little too precious and yes , weird - frittering away too much time on the supporting players ... before getting to the really good stuff .
cyrille-edouard cottin was a french industrialist and racing driver , co-founder of the automobiles cottin et desgouttes company .  life  cyrille-edouard cottin was the 4th of the 7 children of cyrille cottin who had married louise payen in 1863 , hailing from a large family of the lyon bourgeoisie , the descendants of which have had numerous alliances with french nobility . his father held his fortune from the family silk business created in 1830 and of which he was an associate : les petits fils de claude-joseph bonnet . due to the large number of descendants of the latter , the custom was that only the elder sons of each branch could enter the business . thus , cyrille-edouard cottin , who could not enter , created his own business and teamed with pierre desgoutte in 1906 , when he was 36 years old . he invested his fortune , helped by his wife s dowry , and the trust which he got from his friends , relationships and family in the lyons middle-class . he was           with a definite charisma . all of this together with the high technical competence of pierre desgoutte , allowed the new company cottin&amp; desgoutte sto develop rapidly . cyrille cottin was also first-class racing driver , racing both in france and abroad in north africa , zurich and australia where whe won the 400-mile race . after world war i , he returned to competition , winning regularly on his famous   m type   . when the company encoutered its first difficulties in 1929 , andr citron , who was already mass-producing automobiles , proposed to acquire the company . through pride , cottin refused and eventually lost most of his fortune .  references  **14;19646;references
  czarface   is a collaborative studio album by american rapper inspectah deck and underground hip hop duo 7l &amp; esoteric . the album was released on february 19 , 2013 . the album features guest appearances from roc marciano , oh no , ghostface killah , action bronson , cappadonna and vinnie paz . the albums production comes from 7l , spada4 and dj premier .  background  in february 2013 , during an interview with hiphopdx , inspectah deck spoke about the origins of the album , saying : i really do nt think there were a lot of goals or things like that . for me right now , its taking off better than anticipated because i guess i underestimated the peoples need to hear something worth listening to . so i did   czarface   , ive done a couple records with 7l &amp; esoteric back in the day with speaking real words and another 12th chamber . ive done two songs with them already , and we built up a lot of buzz just off of those two           on tour with the wu-tang clan , but we all talked about it a while agoabout doing this type of project . it all just came together at the right time , and the whole   czarface   thing was supposed to be a hero to save hip hop . i did nt really have the whole cartoon , comic book vision all in my head at that time . i sat down with esoteric , he brought that thought to light and i thought that would be a good idea . a lot of the real hip hop heads , the true school hip hop generation , they know what that covers all about . we grew up with those comic books , some of us are still die-hard fans of that , and i thought bringing that together with just being the classic hip hop beats and rhymes of the  90s and before . i thought that combination was going to bring something to the game . i think   czarface   is the blue-collar album of rap right now . i think its           ben wallace and them . they really had no star but the whole team was blue-collar , and everybody gave that effort . i think this is one of those underdog albums that , when the smoke clears from all of those big guns going off , youre still going to hear these shots going . i listened to the project really head-to-toe for the first time the other day and im like , it sounds good man . just let it play from beginning to end , thats how we used to do when we had cassette tapes ; just let it roll then go to the other side . i think this is one of those personally , just listening to the sound i think . we leaked three songsthe one with roc marciano cement 3 s , the one with action bronson its raw and the one shoguns with vinnie paz . i believe that created a real buzz for it right now , so its getting good feedback and a good vibe . i think this is one of the smart choices for 2013 . esoteric also            basically it started out as 7ls idea to put out something like a white label or kind of a diamond in the rough slab of vinyl that really had no promotion at all and was just kind of leaked out there . you know we still have that  90s mentality . with me and inspectah deck on the mic and 7l on production , we were just going to have it sneak out . as we started recording , we thought we could actually sell this , so we started to conceptualize the idea of   czarface   and having that be the name of the group . the character represents the three of us when were on the mic and doing damage or whatever . the idea was to make a few records , keep it really lyrical and give the people what they wanted and expect from the wu-tang clans most heralded swordsman so to speak , and me and 7l from boston . so it was just doing what we do in the past but just come out swinging in 2013 .  esoteric           :  it was just important for us to work with lyricists that we respect and just keep it a really organic record . were not trying to dial in an akon hook or something like that thats going to make a record blow up in a way that does nt really suit us . i think the natural thing to do is to get some wu members , some members from my crewweve got vinnie paz on the record . everyone was really excited and easy to work with because they saw our vision . obviously the wu guys with an allegiance to deck just made it a real easy thing . and 7l wanted to get action bronson and roc marciano on the record cause these guys are really poppin right now . it might add a little flavor to the record for maybe a younger listener who is more in-tuned to what theyre doing right now , and obviously they destroyed it . i have a tremendous amount of respect for them , so it was just a good fit for the album .  esoteric also spoke           well that was something that i wanted to do for the album . one of the things that always stood out to me with deck was that hed reference superheroes every once in a whilesomething about the claws of wolverine , peter parkerall these different things . ive always been into comic books , and i think our discography kind of shows everything with that . but i kinda think thats how we meet too , and if we had a figurehead for the album , i came up with   czarface   the name . i ran it by deck , and he loved it , and then i had to find an artist that kind of brings   czarface   to life . i wanted it to be very jack kirby influenced . i just love jack kirbys art . lamour supreme , who works for mishka , had done stuff for jack kirbys museum , and it made a lot of sense for him to do the art and he killed it . he developed   czarface   based on the ideas           it to look like and what he represented . i would reference ultron and major blood and all these different metal-clad villains or heroes , and he just went with it . were really happy with what he created .  critical response    czarface   was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics . at metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 6 reviews , which indicates positive reviews . omar burgess of hiphopdx gave the album four out of five stars , saying   czarface   has no major flaws . its obviously not for everyone , yet even when incorporating current critical favorites like action bronson and mr. mfn exquire , no compromises are made . inspectah deck , 7l &amp; esoteric use  90s east coast hip hop as a blueprint to innovate , and ultimately , thats what made that era so special in the first place . bogar alonso of   xxl   gave the album           supposed last golden era , might make some queeze , and for good reason . hip-hop purists have long sucked on the decade like a warm thumb , afraid of the cold , mean world that lay ahead . but   czarface   , also the name for deck and co. s group , keeps matters as fresh . the albums marqueewith names like roc marciano , action bronson , and mr. mfn exquireassures just that . cement 3s , its raw , and poisonous thoughtslisted in the order of appearance of the guests mentionedcome off as love letters rather than industry rub-offs . if the above trio were operating in the late 90s , theyd be dropping similar heat . bryan hahn of   the source   gave the album a positive review , saying   czarface   does nt fall short of what it wanted to accomplish-knocking the chumps out the ring . it does nt pretend to deliver positive messages for the kids or even tell heart wrenching stories about the hood . plain and simple , 7l masterminded sinister beats while           the potential of the often-mislead art of lyricism can sound like . long live ,   czarface   . matthew fiander of popmatters gave the album a six out of ten , saying song to song we see confident production and expert rhyming from guys we know can do both . but while inspectah deck may be one of the most effortless emcees in wu-tang , he s not the most narrative . neither is esoteric . so while the songs here bang in all the ways you want , they rarely catch you off guard and they rarely tell you where theyre going . not that they need to , but that sense of direction , out of the past and toward something new , might have elevated a good album to something great . mark bozzer of   exclaim !   gave the album a seven out of ten , saying minus all of the corny sound bites , this album undoubtedly keeps the underground renaissance sizzling .  commercial performance  the album debuted at number 34 on the us billboard top r&amp;b/hip-hop albums           listing

birthplace = paris alain kirili is a french sculptor . he is recognized for his post-minimalist abstract sculptures in forged iron and his large-scale public sculptures . his work has subsequently been the subject of numerous gallery and museum exhibitions in america and europe , and has received considerable critical interest from art historians , such as thierry dufrne , robert c. morgan , robert rosenblum , and kirk varnedoe . alain kirili lives and works in paris and new york .  early career  alain kirili was born to a french family in paris . at the age of 19 , during the course of his early artistic training , kirili discovered sculptures   cubi xviii   and   cubi xix   , exhibited at the muse rodin in paris and was immediately inspired by the american sculptor s work . kirili traveled to the united states that same year . during his stay , kirili visited the major museum collections in new york , washington , baltimore , philadelphia , chicago , and detroit , where           became an especially influential figure to him . alain kirili met 1966 the korean painter in paris . during this period , kirili became part of the circle of intellectuals , writers and artists around roland barthes and the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , philippe sollers and julia kristeva . his first solo show was at sonnabend gallery in paris in 1972 . among other works , this show included a floor piece which already contained many of the elements that would characterize his future practice . this work is reproduced in the exhibition catalog , and accompanied with a text by the french poet and art critic marcelin pleynet . ileana sonnabend introduced kirili to robert rauschenberg , whom he credits with introducing him to important personalities in the new york art scene . kirili had several shows at sonnabend gallery in paris and geneva before his sculptures were first exhibited in new york in 1976 at the inaugural show of the institute for art and urban resources           1977 , his was included in the documenta vi in kassel , germany . that same year , he married the french photographer ariane lopez-huici . in 1978 while traveling in india for the first time , kirili was inspired by the hindu concept of yoni / lingam , a sculptural representation of the feminine and the masculine forming a symbolic union in the manner of base and sculpture in kirilis work . in his article ,   lingaistics   published in art in america in 1982 , kirili evokes more specifically the sexual and repetitive aspect of these abstract and highly symbolic religious objects . kirili s first solo show in new york was held at sonnabend gallery where he exhibited a series of forged iron sculptures . in 1979 , the museum of modern art acquired one of his pieces for the first time , the acquisition coinciding with his move to new york .  oeuvre   early sculpture in forged iron            of kirilis earliest forged iron pieces ; it consists in a thinly shaped iron bar growing out of its base in modeled bronze . the tactile and spiritual quality of the sculpture distinguishes it from then-prevailing tendencies in conceptual art . art historian robert rosenblum perceived in this work a vertical force , familiar in the paintings of barnett newman , suggesting a spiritually rather than materially assertive human presence . the concept of verticality is indeed crucial in the context of kirili s oeuvre . in an interview with art critic philippe piguet , kirili addresses furthermore the importance he ascribes to the concepts of circumvolution and incarnation . one of his early sculptures was shown at the institute for art and urban resources in 1976 . others , e.g.   untitled   and   laocoon ii   , both representative of this first series in forged iron , are now in the nasher collection , dallas , and the fonds national dart contemporain , france , respectively . other early sculptures           ) explore the upward movement of a curved metal bar seeking support on a wall , as well as the potentials of a horizontal rather than vertical extension . kirili once described his aesthetic as organic simplicity in the tradition of , but formally not attached to , minimalism and abstract expressionism . indeed , his early sculptures are already concerned with tactility and gesture , emphasizing the active involvement of the artists hand in the process of creation . kirili embraces a process that is immediate , combining emotions , intuitions , and the subconscious , in a free improvisation with the material .    commandement   series  the   commandement   series of sculptures is one of kirilis most important and ongoing bodies of work . this series of distinct geometric forms , which art historians have described as mystical fonts and abstract alphabets , rises 15 to 35 inches above the ground and individual examples are composed of up to 90 elements . according to kirili s statement , the title            the jewish museum in new york . he came across the word rimonim and was told that , in hebrew , it referred to the pomegranate fruit and , by extension , to the commandments in the torah , which are said to be as numerous as the seeds in a pomegranate . the forms of the elements in the   commandements   series were influenced by his encounter , on new york s lower east side , with the torah calligraphers who trace their letters in the tradition of stone engravers . this series is concerned with the symbolic value of basic forms , and particularly with the world of glyphs , signs , and texts , in a way that evokes not only kirili s fascination with ancient scripture , but also his ties to the parisian milieu of writers and intellectuals such as roland barthes , philippe sollers , and julia kristeva . **6;84291;br in 1992 , soprano saxophonist steve lacy , performed in and amongst kirili s   commandement   at new york s thread waxing space , launching an ongoing series of           . many of these improvisations , for example with billy bang , thomas buckner , roy campbell , jr. , roy haynes , steve lacy , sunny murray , william parker , joe mcphee , cecil taylor , among others , are documented in   celebrations   published in 1997 by christian bourgois , paris . the earliest   commandements   were created out of iron and either forged or cut with a torch . kirili continued this series with a variety of materials , including styrofoam , painted iron , and pigmented concrete . kirili first experimented with pigmented concrete in   commandement , claude monet   , which was shown at the muse de lorangerie , paris as part of the exhibition   kirili et les nymphas   . **6;84299;br   rythmes dautomne   , the most recent of the   commandements   , was commissioned by the city of paris and exhibited on the parvis of the htel de ville in the heart of paris .   rythmes dautomne           grey , pigmented concrete , invites the public into its 6,500 square feet wide space of signs in order to play , converse , dance , or meditate.  a dialogue between variety and unity  kirili has constantly pursued an interest in abstract modeling , which has resulted over the years in the creation of an entire body of work in terra cotta . art historian kirk varnedoe describes these works as heavily manipulated and often in rich fleshy tones , invested with more feminine form and with an altogether different energy , especially compared to his forged iron pieces . in 1978 kirili began including iron elements and especially iron wire in the terra cotta pieces . the first terra cotta series was presented in two consecutive exhibitions , along with kirili s forged iron pieces , at galerie maeght in paris in 1984 and 1985 , including the series   ivresse   , now in the collection of the centre georges pompidou . in 1985 kirili was invited to exhibit at the muse rodin . kirili has           rodins oeuvre , as these forces resonate in a more abstract manner in kirili s own work . he has also written about rodins erotic drawings in rodin , dessins rotiques , published by editions gallimard in 1987 .   nudity   , modeled in clay and cast in bronze , was created for this show and is kirilis first monumental bronze . its surface is densely modeled and insistently abstract , but nonetheless displays the pleasure of rendering human flesh as art historian paula rand hornbostel put it . kirili simultaneously presented a group of new sculptures-tables , table like sculptures , entitled   gnrations   . initiated in 1984 ,   gnrations   as kirk varnedoe suggests brings together a complex array of individual smaller sculptures pieces from the  commandment  series , and forged-iron works of various scales in an approach of formal unity .   gnrations   with their lively tempo and bright openness explore a dialogue between heterogeneous forms and media , between variety and unity . kirili           in 1986 , to experiment with aluminum . while applying a torch to the aluminum , kirili discovered the material s explosive reaction . this explosion , which resembled a floral mechanism , was perceived by kirili as a very expressionistic and emotional sign , which emerged from the regularity of the vertical . art critic philippe dagen emphasized the velvetiness and metallicness of these aluminum pieces in his essay for the catalog of kirilis solo exhibition at the muse dart moderne de sainte-etienne where he presented several of these sculptures , e.g.   king i   and   symphonie des psaumes   . from 2008 on , kirili has devoted himself to the creation of several series of organic wire sculpture , with partial rubber inclusions , in different colors , which he conceptualizes as three-dimensional drawings . the process of creation is based on velocity and free improvisation , similar to kirili s technique of modeling clay . his series   aria   was created between his studios in new york and paris ,           a select number of hartung s sculptures . this show was presented in two parts , at the foundation hartung bergman and the muse picasso in 2012/2013.  large-scale public sculpture  art historian kirk varnedoe points out that scale is of crucial concern to kirili , and a general tendency toward greater scale has been characteristic of his recent work . **6;84307;br kirili considers   grand commandement blanc   as his first large-scale public sculpture . in 1992 , he initiated a series of large-scale limestone sculptures of which   rsistance   is the most recent one . the title is inspired by a maxim of the french resistance which he adopted : creation is an act of resistance and resistance is an act of creation . commissioned by the city of grenoble ,   rsistance   is composed of seven binary elements of giant burgundy limestone blocks . each element is approximately 8 1           3 1 / 2 feet wide . two other similar sculptures , both commissions , are permanently installed in france :   improvisation   , 2000 , in dijon and   hommage charlie parker   , 2007 , in paris . **6;84315;br art historian thierry dufrne characterized this series as giant drippings because of their scale and the spontaneous and their rapid on-site installation , which is accomplished without any preliminary drawings . the gesture is monumental , spontaneous , free , and rapid .  exhibitions  alain kirili has exhibited widely in america and europe . his sculptures have been presented in numerous museum exhibitions , including : institute of art and urban resources , ps1 , museum haus lange , krefeld , dallas museum of art , dallas , frankfurter kunstverein , francfort , muse rodin , paris , brooklyn museum , new york , muse dorsay , paris , muse de lorangerie , paris , and muse des beaux-arts de caen . **6;84323;br he has also

, paris , marlborough gallery , new york , galerie akira ikeda , new york , berlin , tokyo , and galerie pice unique , paris . **6;84331;br whereas several of these shows were conceived as dialogues with historical artists , his work has also been exhibited in group or two person shows with more contemporary artists , notably with larry bell , john chamberlain , ron gorchov , mark di suvero

  queloides   is an ongoing cultural and curatorial project in cuban art that seeks to highlight the persistence of racist stereotypes and ideas of racial difference in cuban society and culture . initiated in 1997 by artist alexis esquivel and by art critic omar pascual castillo , who organized the exhibit   queloides i parte   , the project was later led by the late art critic ariel ribeaux diago , who organized two important additional exhibits :   ni msicos ni deportistas   , for which he wrote an award-winning essay , and   queloides   . queloides or keloids are raised scars that , many in cuban believe , appear most frequently on the black skin . the title makes reference to the scars of racism , on the one hand , and to persistent popular beliefs that there are natural differences between whites and blacks . the main purpose of these exhibits was to initiate a public conversation around topics that had been taboo in           2005 ) explained , i , as well as other colleagues had many questions and concerns about racial prejudice in cuba , and i was convinced that through art we could express a valuable and instructive point of view .. in queloides we paid attention to a non-romanticized vision of the daily existence of cuban blacks the artists focused on the black person as a marginalized individual faced with economic disadvantages , traumas , and self reflection . although these were groundbreaking cultural events that addressed issues of race and discrimination in cuban society , they received very little coverage in the cuban press and were quickly forgotten . in 2010 historian alejandro de la fuente and artist elio rodrguez valds organized a new edition of the exhibit , titled     . this exhibit opened at the centro wifredo lam in havana in april 2010 and was later presented at the in pittsburgh , in new york city , and the neil l. and angelica zander at the w.e.b . du bois institute for african american research at harvard university . the cuban media ignored the exhibit again           including favorable reviews in leading art journals such as     ,     ,     and     . the   pittsburgh post-gazette   called it a ground-breaking exhibition and listed it as number four in the year s best art in the city in 2010 . in 2011 the important cuban journal   artecubano   published its own review of   queloides   . referring to   queloides : race and racism in cuban contemporary art   , literary scholar ana beln martn-sevillano has written : the impact of the   queloides   sequence in the cultural field has made the term synonymous with the racial debate in cuba . designed with a comprehensive and inclusive view , one of the exhibit s major achievements has been to include representative artwork that covers the diverse array of techniques and strategies used in contemporary cuban art to address the complexity of the cultural and social processes of racialization . furthermore , the 2010   queloides             not participated in the previous shows : belkis ayn , maria magdalena campos pons , and marta mara prez bravo . the work of these artist offers a compelling approach to issues of race and gender .  sources  de la fuente , alejandro . the new afro-cuban cultural movement and the debate on race in contemporary cuba ,   journal of latin american studies   40:4 , 697-720. de la fuente , alejandro , ed .   queloides : race and racism in cuban contemporary art   . pittsburgh : mattress factory . isbn 978-0822961529 casamayor cisneros , odette . queloides : inevitables , lacerantes . en torno a la exposicin   queloides : raza y racismo en el arte cubano contemporneo   ,   artecubano   2:22-26 . esquivel , alexis . queloide , la cicatriz dormida , in judith bettelheim ,   afrocuba works on paper 19682003   . san francisco : san francisco state           .   cuba represent ! : cuban arts , state power , and the making of new revolutionary cultures   . duke university press . isbn 978-0822338918 martn-sevillano , ana beln . crisscrossing gender , ethnicity and race : african religious legacy in cuban contemporary s women s art ,   cuban studies   42:136-54.  footnotes

the juvenile diabetes cure alliance is a new york-based nonprofit focused on bringing about a practical cure for type 1 diabetes . the organization defines a practical cure as any solution that gives people living with the disease the chance to live a normal , unrestricted life . the jdca is a privately funded research and advocacy organization for type 1 diabetes donors . the independent nonprofit conducts analysis on major diabetes charities such as jdrf , writes reports on cure progress and charity spending , educates donors , and provides counsel for large donors on structuring their gifts .  history  the jdca was founded in 2011 by brian kelly , chairman of gaming company activision blizzard , after his son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes . kelly founded the organization to accelerate a cure for type 1 within his sons lifetime . he wanted to bring best practices from the business world to drive accountability in the nonprofit research world and stimulate high-impact giving . the mission of the jdca is to direct donor contributions to the charitable organizations that most           1 practical cure by 2025 . the jdca is a 501 organization funded by the brian and joelle kelly family foundation . it does not directly solicit donations .  advocacy  the jdca advocates for research spending toward a practical cure that would enable people with type 1 to live with blood sugar testing once a week or less ; eat an unrestricted diet ; require only a simple regimen of medication ; sleep worry-free ; experience only minimal diabetes side effects ; and experience fast recovery from surgery . according the organizations research , only six research projects out of more than 300 currently in human clinical trials meet that definition . by publishing its own reports , the jdca tracks how much money is being donated to diabetes research foundations and whether the funds are being used for cure research or other areas such as non-cure research , administrative expenses or public education . the jdca evaluates and analyzes the finances of diabetes charities based on how publicly traded companies report their earnings and expenses , providing its network of alliance members with information on           cure research . in 2013 , author brenda novak donated all the proceeds from the ninth annual brenda novak for the cure of diabetes online auction to practical cure research at the diabetes research institute .  research  the jdca issues regular reports on diabetes charities and research organizations . its major annual report , state of the cure , analyzes the donation revenue and spending of diabetes charities , including jdrf , american diabetes association , joslin diabetes center and diabetes research institute foundation . the 2013 report found that only 2 percent of the funds donated to those organizations is spent on research that would deliver a cure for type 1 diabetes by 2025 . according to the jdca , there are currently four pathways that meet the definition of a practical cure : islet transplantation ; drugs that would stop autoimmune attack and enable cells to regenerate ; devices that would reliably replace the function of the pancreas ; and cell retraining therapies . within those categories , there are six projects in human clinical trials that could deliver a cure by 2025 : *living cell technologies           lab at mass generals bcg vaccine *viacytes stem cell therapy *sanford researchs combination therapy *cliniques universitaires saint-luc monolayer cellular device additionally , the jdca tracks projects in animal and late-stage preclinical testing . the jdca does not believe that diabetes foundations should abandon research projects that target complications , glucose control and prevention . rather , the organization suggests that 25 percent of donations should support practical cure research initiatives .  criticism  the jdcas approach has been criticized as controversial for its focus on outcomes and expediency rather than traditional methods of deciding what projects to fund . critics of the jdca have stated that the definition of a cure can vary , a cure by 2025 is unobtainable and that treatment is an equally valid outlet for funding . diabetes charities point out that they focus on goals that go beyond finding a cure , such as teaching people how to prevent the disease or reduce its effects through healthy eating and exercise .  references

  bismarck : the man and the statesman   is a biography of the german statesman otto von bismarck by the english historian a. j. p. taylor . it was first published in the united kingdom by hamish hamilton in june 1955.  origins  in a book review written in 1943 , taylor wrote that to write a life of bismarck within reasonable compass would be one of the greatest of historical achievements ; but perhaps it is impossible . the material is overwhelming ; and to make matters worse , bismarck himself has left , in speeches , conversations or his reminiscences , versions of all the principal events usually deliberately misleading . taylor had previously written   germany s first bid for colonies 1884-1885 : a move in bismarck s european policy   and   the struggle for mastery in europe 18481918   , both of which in different ways covered bismarck s foreign policy . to learn more about his personal life , taylor read many biographies of bismarck and a few monographs in french , german and           later wrote that the biography was one of the books he had most enjoyed writing : i knew all the historical background already . now i found bismarck s personality fascinating as well and he became one of the few i should like to recall from the dead . it is a very good exercise for an historian to stray into biography - a field seemingly so similar and yet fundamentally different . perhaps no historian can really handle individual psychology or make an individual the centre of his book . all the same i think my   bismarck   is the best on him ever written .  contents  taylor s bismarck is not the junker and iron chancellor but a complicated , urban intellectual , the clever , sophisticated son of a clever , sophisticated mother , masquerading all his life as his heavy , earthen father . instead of working from a thought out plan for the unification of germany , bismarck was an opportunist , taking advantage where he knew he could succeed . an emotional man , bismarck was able through politics and            reception  the book was an immediate success , outselling all of taylor s previous books both in britain and america . harold nicolson in a review said he enjoyed taylor s irreverence and his sharp snaps of paradox . in a review for the   new statesman   , the military historian michael howard wrote that  taylor carries out his revaluation in the clear , sharp , epigrammatic prose which makes all his work as stimulating as champagne - and which makes one wonder , sometimes , whether it was all really as simple as that . his mind is a convex mirror in which events appear brilliantly coloured , brilliantly distinct , and sometimes a little distorted . he has many of the virtues of macaulay , and one or two of his faults . the pattern is too sharply etched ; the epigrams are too neat ; the judgements are too final ; but how refreshing it is to read a historian who is not afraid of patterns , epigrams and judgements !  the american historian of germany , gordon a. craig ,           a long needed account in english of the main facts of bismarck s career , an account which is at once readable , up to date ... and balanced ... in the second place , he paints a fascinating portrait of one of the most complicated personalities in an age which was filled with gifted and original minds ... the chapter on the corrosive effects of the bismarckian tradition in germany s intellectual development is not the least interesting part of this highly provocative study . fritz stern reviewed the book for the   political science quarterly   and said that while there are many other biographies of bismarck that are more detailed , as a perceptive psychological sketch of this massively complex being , mr. taylor s   bismarck   stands unsurpassed . a german edition was not published until 1962 , and it was not much noticed there . however german historian wolfgang mommsen later said that taylor s biography was better than any german synthesis .  notes

the   noli me tangere   casket was a small silver-gilt casket made in 1356 for the aachen cathedral treasury . it measured 15.2 cm in length , 3.7 cm in height and 4.8 cm in width . the casket was kept in the   marienschrein   together with the key relics of the cathedral until the nineteenth century and the casket remained in the possession of the cathedral treasury until its destruction during the second world war .  the origin of the   noli me tangere   casket  four so-called great relics belong to aachen cathedral : the dress of mary , the nappy of jesus , the decapitation cloth of john the baptist and the loincloth of christ , along with other lesser relics . since 1349 , these cloths have been displayed and venerated as contact relics in aachen every seven years during the aachen pilgrimage . one legend says that it was during such a pilgrimage that a pilgrim was           of the sacred cloths , despite the strict guard . at the death of this pilgrim a year later , he is said to have repented of his deed and returned the stolen fabric to the aachen cathedral chapter . the canon of cathedral chapter is said to have been so embarrassed by this evidence of his negligence that , in 1356 , he ordered the production of a small silver box to store the returned bits of relic in . after the casket was locked , he wrapped it in a green silk rippon , sealed it and attached a parchment , on which was written in medieval latin :   anno domini m ccc lvi in festo magne dedicacionis ecclesie beate marie virginis aquensis fuit ordinatum per capitulum dicte ecclesie ad hoc indictum quod presens sarculum cui hec scedula est appensa de cetero non apperiatur et hoc propter specialem statum et utilitatem ecclesie antedicte .   in the year of the lord 1356 , at the feast of the great dedication of the church of the blessed virgin mary in aachen , it was ordered by the           which this document is appended , not be opened hereafter and this on account of the special status and expediency of the aforesaid church . on account of this inscription the silver casket became known colloquially by the name noli me tangere . the expression derives from the gospel of john , in which the resurrected jesus prevents mary magdalene from touching him with these words .  mysterious contents  in the following 448 years , no one changed the condition of the casket . it was removed from the marienschrein along with the other relics every seven years , blessed , and then returned to the shrine . at the end of the late middle ages , the casket was often seen as a valuable relic itself and in accordance with its special significance as a relic its contents were not allowed to be view by anyone . a story was reported that a dean of aachen had opened the casket out of curiosity and was immediately struck blind as a result - increasing the mystery around the small casket .  opening of the           to have been revealed by an accident . at the beginning of the nineteenth century aachen and the rheinland were under french occupation and in 1804 empress josphine , wife of napoleon , visited aachen . on this occasion , it is said , the bishop of aachen , marc-antoine berdolet , showed the empress some of the relics of aachen , as was usual for high-status visitors . among other things , the casket was handed to her . the lock gave way when touched and the casket came open . inside there were cloth fragments from the aachen relics . the empress was very frightened , since someone had told her the story of the blinded dean . with the opening of the casket the centuries-old mystery about the contents was finally revealed .  location of the casket  at the time of the second world war , most of the aachen cathedral treasures were moved multiple times , ending up in siegen , from which they were returned to aachen once more after the war . a few pieces of treasure remained in aachen , however ,            noli me tangere   casket . msgr . crumbach , then master of the treasury secured both objects in his cellar during the bombing of the city . but on 10 july 1941 , a phosphorus bomb hit his house and destroyed the casket with its contents .  references  * johannes crumbach , peter lentz :   das kstchen rhr mich nicht an ! im aachener domschatz.   verlag johannes volk , aachen 1937. * ernst gnther grimme :   der aachener domschatz.   . 2 . auflage , schwann , dsseldorf 1972 , s. 75-76. * d. p. j. weynands :   zur geschichte der aachener heiligtumsfahrt .   einhard verlag , aachen 2000 , isbn 3-930701-73-1.

location=leipzig * * /1732 ? location=leipzig * location=leipzig text = anonymous chorale = stanzas from 9 chorales the structure of johann sebastian bach s   st john passion   , bwv 245 , is shown in tables below . the original latin title     translates to the passion after john . bach s large choral composition , written to be performed in a lutheran service on good friday , is based on the passion , as told in two chapters from the gospel of john in the translation by martin luther , and , with two short interpolations from the gospel of matthew . during the vespers service , the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon . part i covers the events until peter s denial of jesus , part ii concludes with the burial of jesus . the bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a scene of           most bach cantatas . an anonymous poet supplied a few texts himself , quoted from other passion texts and inserted chorales by nine hymnwriters . bach led the first performance on 7 april 1724 in leipzig s . he repeated it several times between 1724 and 1749 , experimenting with different movements and changes to others , resulting in four versions . the passion , close to bach s heart , has an immediate dramatic quality .  structure   text    gospel   the gospel account by john narrates the story in five scenes . the corresponding movement numbers are given from the     . part i  arrest , , kidron valley  denial , , palace of the high priest kaiphas part ii  crucifixion and death , , golgatha  burial , , burial site some musicologists regard movement 24 as the conclusion of scene 3 , the aria bach incorporated two short interpolations from the gospel of matthew ,   chorales             narration , stanzas from lutheran hymns . possibly bach had an influence on their selection . he set them all in common time for four parts , the instruments playing with the voices . five chorales conclude a scene , a chorale opens part ii . five chorales comment within a scene . including the central movement of the whole passion . one chorale accompanies the bass soloist in an aria . most chorale texts were written in the 16th and 17th century , by authors of the reformation such as martin luther , martin schalling and michael weie , and by hymn writers including paul gerhardt and johann heermann . the central chorale is not part of a common hymn .   contemporary text   on a third level of text , contemporary poetry reflects the biblical narration . it was compiled by an unknown author , who partly used existing text . from the           etching by christian fritzsch file:christian weise kupferstich von j c bcklin.jpg  scoring  the work is scored for vocal soloists , soprano , alto , tenor and bass , a four part choir satb , and an orchestra of two flauto traverso , two oboes , two oboes da caccia , two violins , viola , and basso continuo . bach added some instruments in arias for special effects , old-fashioned already at the time , such as lute , viola damore and viola da gamba . bach did not differentiate the vox christi , singing the words of jesus , from the other bass recitatives and arias , nor the evangelist from the tenor arias .  symmetry  the work displays a thoughtful symmetryin music  versions  bach led the first performance on 7 april 1724 in version 2 , bach opened with a chorale fantasia on in version 3 , after bach wrote his   st matthew passion   ,           , bach returned to the first version , possibly in 1739 , but revised it thoroughly . he began a new score which covers 12 movements . as christoph wolff observes : the fragmentary revised score constitutes an extensive stylistic overhaul with painstaking improvements to the part-writing and a partial restructuring of the instrumentation ; particular attention was paid to the word-setting in the recitatives and the continuo accompaniment . wolff writes : bach experimented with the st john passion as he did with no other large-scale composition ,  tables of movements  the following tables give an overview of version i of the passion , first performed in 1724 . two versions of movement numbers are given , first that of the neue bach-ausgabe , then that of the older bach-werke-verzeichnis . voices appear in one of three columns , depending on the text source , bible , contemporary poetic reflection , and chorale . the instrumentation is added , using abbreviations for instruments , followed by key and time signature , and the nba number of a corresponding movement within the work            part ii   --  overview  in the following , the movement numbers are those of the nba , version i , unless otherwise noted .  the chorales in detail  the first chorale , movement 3 , is inserted after jesus said to arrest him , but let the disciples go . the second chorale , movement 5 , ends the first scene , after jesus remarks that he has to be obedient . is stanza 4 of luther s 1539 hymn , a paraphrase of the lord s prayer . the third chorale , movement 11 , is inserted after jesus asks the one who beat him for justification . two stanzas from paul gerhardt s 1647 hymn comment the scene , stanza 3 , , and stanza 4 , , highlighting the personal responsibility of the speaking sinner for the suffering of jesus . the fourth chorale , movement 14 , ends           i. after the denial of peter , the fifth chorale , movement 15 , opens part ii and the third scene . the sixth chorale , movement 17 , comments in two more stanzas from herzliebster jesu , after jesus addressed the different kind of his kingdom . stanza 8 , the seventh chorale , movement 22 , is the central movement of the whole passion , which interrupts the conversation of pilate and the crowd by a general statement of the importance of the passion for salvation : the seventh chorale , movement 26 , ends the scene of the court hearing , after pilate refuses to change the inscription . the eighth chorale , movement 28 , is related to jesus telling his mother and john to take care of each other . the ninth chorale , movement 32 , is part of the bass aria which follows immediately after the report of the death of jesus . the tenth chorale , movement 37 , ends the scene of the crucifixion . the eleventh chorale , movement 40 , ends            scores   * * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web   books   * *   online sources   * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web * cite web de:johannes-passion werkbersicht fr:passion selon saint jeanstructure gnrale

there are several well-known and commonly used nicknames referring to portland , oregon .  city of roses  the official , and also most common , nickname for portland is the city of roses or rose city . the first known reference to portland as the city of roses was made by visitors to an 1888 episcopal church convention . the nickname grew in popularity after the 1905 lewis and clark centennial exposition where mayor harry lane suggested that the city needed a festival of roses . the first portland rose festival was held two years later and remains the city s major annual festival a century later . there are many other cities and towns known as rose city or the city of roses . the nickname is often attributed to leo samuel , who founded the oregon life insurance company in 1906 . samuel , who moved to portland in 1871 , grew roses outside his home . he placed a pair of shears outside his garden so people could snip a rose from his garden to           to plant their own roses outside their homes and business . today , roses are still planted outside the standard insurance company s home office building in downtown portland . this nickname inspired the name for the four-year-old female asian elephant who arrived in 1953 , rosy . the first elephant ever to live in oregon , she remained the matriarch of the oregon zoo s herd and gave birth to six calves before her death in 1993 . on august 31 , 1994 , her daughter me-tu became the first elephant in north america to have twins . on august 23 , 2008 , her granddaughter rose-tu gave birth to samudra , the first third-generation elephant born in the united states . on june 18 , 2003 , the city council unanimously approved a resolution adopting city of roses as the city s official nickname .  bridgetown  portland is known as bridgetown or bridge city due to numerous bridges crossing the willamette and columbia rivers . the river width spanned varies from 850to7850 ft , and all of the bridges also span shoreline           . in total , there are eleven bridges over the willamette , including eight in the central area , and three over the columbia .  beervana  a portmanteau of beer and nirvana , portland has more brewpubs per capita than any other city in the united states . there are six portland entries in americas 100 best beer bars : 2012 from   draft magazine   , more than any other city .  little beirut  staffers of former u.s. president george h. w. bush used to refer to portland as little beirut because of the protesters he encountered during his visits .  p-town  portland is sometimes affectionately called p-town by some locals .  pdx  the city of portland is nicknamed pdx after the international air transport association airport code for the portland international airport which is within the city limits . for example , the domain name for portland state university of pdx.edu was chosen in 1987 , since psu.edu had already been given to           , many portland businesses include pdx in their domain names to indicate their portland location .

proportional myoelectric control can be used to activate robotic lower limb exoskeletons . a proportional myoelectric control system utilizes a microcontroller or computer that inputs electromyography signals from sensors on the leg muscle and then activates the corresponding joint actuator proportionally to the emg signal .  background  a robotic exoskeleton is a type of orthosis that uses actuators to either assist or resist the movement of a joint of an intact limb ; this is not to be confused with a powered prosthesis , which replaces a missing limb . there are four purposes that robotic lower limb exoskeletons can accomplish : * enhancement of human performance , which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance * long-term assistance , which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by themselves while wearing an exoskeleton * study of human locomotion , which utilizes robotic exoskeletons to better understand human neuromuscular control , energetics , and/or kinematics of locomotion * post-injury rehabilitation , which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform better later without the use of the exoskeleton robotic lower limb exoskeletons can be controlled by several methods , including a footswitch , gait phase estimation , and myoelectric control . this article focuses on myoelectric control .  control methods  sensors on the skin detect electromyography signals from the muscles of the wearers leg . emg signals can be measured from just one muscle or many , depending on the type of the exoskeleton and how many joints are actuated . each signal measured is then sent to a controller , which is either an onboard microcontroller or to a nearby computer . onboard microcontrollers are used for long-term assistive devices since the wearer must be able to walk in different locations while wearing the exoskeleton , whereas computers not carried by the exoskeleton can be           not have to walk very far in a clinical or lab environment . the controller filters out noise from the emg signals and then normalizes them so as to better analyze the muscle activation pattern . the normalized emg value of a muscle represents its activation percentage , since the emg signal is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible emg reading for the muscle it came from . the maximum emg reading is generated when a muscle is fully contracted . an alternative method to normalization is to proportionally match the actuator power to the emg signal between a minimum activation threshold and an upper saturation level .  direct proportional myoelectric control  with a proportional myoelectric controller , the power sent to an actuator is proportional to the amplitude of the normalized emg signal from a muscle . when the muscle is inactive , the actuator receives no power from the controller , and when the muscle is fully contracted , the actuator produces maximum torque about the joint it controls . for example , an powered ankle-foot orthosis could employ a pneumatic artificial           level of the soleus . this control method enables the exoskeleton to be controlled by the same neural pathways as the wearer s biological muscles and has been shown to allow individuals to walk with a more normal gait than other control methods , such as using a footswitch . proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over other control methods , such as : * its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeleton * it results in reduced biological muscle recruitment versus kinematic based control methods * it allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control for new motor tasks however , proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to other control methods , including : * the surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in obtaining a reliable emg signal * the system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds and gains * the musculoskeletal system has many synergistic muscles that are not easily accessible via surface emg electrodes * since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control , some           to use an exoskeleton with myoelectric control  proportional myoelectric control with flexor inhibition  direct proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direction , such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee , but is less effective when two joint actuators work in opposition . an example of this would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for dorsiflexion based on tibialis anterior emg and another pneumatic artificial muscle for plantar flexion based on soleus emg . this could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuators and make walking more difficult.ferris , d.p. , gordon , k.e. , sawicki , g.s . and peethambaran , a. : an improved powered ankle-foot orthosis using proportional myoelectric control ,   gait and posture   , 23 , pp 425-428 , 2006 to correct for this unwanted co-activation , a rule can be added to the control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus emg is above a set           more natural gait than with direct proportional control ; flexor inhibition also allows subjects to walk much more easily with combined knee and ankle exoskeletons with bi-directional actuators at each joint .  applications   performance enhancement  performance enhancement deals with increasing typical human capabilities , such as strength or endurance . many full-body robotic exoskeletons currently in development use controllers based on joint torques and angles instead of electromyography . see powered exoskeletons.  long term assistance  one application of a robot lower limb exoskeleton is to assist in the movement of a disabled individual in order to walk . individuals with spinal cord injury , weakened leg muscles , poor neuromuscular control , or who have suffered a stroke could benefit from wearing such a device . the exoskeleton provides torque about a joint in the same direction that emg data indicate the joint is rotating . for example , high emg signals in the vastus medialis and low emg signals in the biceps femoris would indicate that the user is extending his/her leg , therefore           straighten the leg .  study of human locomotion  proportional myoelectric control and robotic exoskeletons have been used in upper limb devices for decades , but engineers have only recently begun utilizing them for lower limb devices to better understand human biomechanics and neural control of locomotion . by using an exoskeleton with a proportional myoelectric controller , scientists can use a non-invasive means of studying the neural plasticity associated with modifying a muscle s force , as well as how motor memories for locomotor control are formed . which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual . robotic lower limb exoskeletons could help in both of these areas .  physiological response  the neuromuscular system has targeted joint torques it tries to generate while walking . assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move one or more leg joints while walking , which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torque in those joints and use less metabolic energy . the muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the           walking without an exoskeleton . the net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actuator torque . disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease , if any , in muscular torque while walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait , or at all ; the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk .  examples  * vanderbilt exoskeleton * rewalk * hal 5 * ekso bionics  see also  * orthotics * neural control of limb stiffness * powered exoskeleton *  references

epochalism an attitude of respect for the progressive spirit of the age and for social and technological advancement - was contrasted by clifford geertz with what he termed the valorisation of traditional values , as a central social polarity pervading developing nations . more broadly , the term used has been used to describe the post-fordist , postmodern belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past ; is something unique in human history .  polarities in emerging economies  epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force , favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance , as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and gemeinschaft . however , in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated : nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices , as well as to epochalism , in order to free themselves from dependence on a western model/western control .  internet epochalism  the rapid rise of the world wide           human phenomenon , wholly divorced from all past experience . evgeny morozov used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that one is living in truly exceptional times an intellectual fallacy i call  epochalism . previous technological advances , as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting , had of course made very similar claims for themselves ; and a. e. housman a century before had denounced the mind which commands no outlook upon the past or the future , but believes that the fashion of the present , unlike all fashions heretofore , will endure perpetually . late modernity however , with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present , makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what morozov saw as its dark fetishism of internet-based solutions - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture .

the hungarian republic was a short-lived republic that existed between august 1919 and february 1920 in the central and western portions of the former hungarian kingdom . the state was established in the aftermath of the hungarian revolutions of 19181919 by counter-revolutionary forces who sought to return to the status quo prior to 31 october 1918.  history  on 6 august 1919 istvn friedrich , leader of the white house comrades association , ousted the government of gyula peidl and seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the royal romanian army . the coup d  tat was met with widespread approval within hungary . the next day , joseph august declared himself regent of hungary and appointed friedrich as prime minister . he was succeeded by kroly huszr on 24 november , who served as prime minister and interim president until the restoration           anti-communist authoritarian government composed of military officers entered budapest in november on the heels of the romanians . a white terror ensued that led to the imprisonment , torture , and execution without trial of communists , socialists , jews , leftist intellectuals , sympathizers with the krolyi and kun regimes , and others who threatened the traditional hungarian political order that the officers sought to re-establish . estimates placed the number of executions at approximately 5,000 . in addition , about 75,000 people were jailed . in particular , the hungarian right-wing and the romanian forces targeted jews for retribution . ultimately , the white terror forced nearly 100,000 people to leave the country , most of them socialists , intellectuals , and middle-class jews . in 1920 and 1921 , internal chaos racked hungary . the white terror continued to plague jews and leftists , unemployment and inflation soared , and penniless hungarian refugees poured across the border from neighboring countries and burdened the floundering economy . the government offered the population little succor . in january 1920 , hungarian men and women cast the first secret ballots in           and agrarian majority to a unicameral parliament . two main political parties emerged : the socially conservative christian national union party and the national smallholders and agricultural labourers party , which advocated land reform . in march the parliament annulled both the pragmatic sanction of 1723 and the compromise of 1867 , and restored the hungarian monarchy but postponed electing a king until civil disorder had subsided .  see also  *hungarian democratic republic *hungarian soviet republic *history of hungary *revolutions and interventions in hungary  notes

fijituvalu relations are diplomatic and other relations between the republic of fiji and tuvalu . relatively speaking , the countries are neighbours in the vast expanse of the pacific ocean ; tuvalu lies directly north of fiji , and they share a maritime border . tuvalu is by far the smaller , lesser developed and more remote of the two countries , and is therefore dependent on its close relationship with fiji . the two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1979 , the year after tuvalu s independence from the united kingdom . as of 2014 , their relations are described by the fijian government as warm and friendly .  overview  the countries were first linked together as british colonies in the late 19th century , when they both came within the jurisdiction of the british western pacific territories , the administrative centre of which was in fiji . after the second world war , tuvalu s first doctors were trained at the fiji school of medicine , while some of the tuvaluans from the overcrowded atoll of vaitupu moved permanently to the island of           still live . fiji continues to provide most of tuvaluans  higher education and vocational training , through the university of the south pacific and the fiji national university . tuvalu does not have its own universities . students attending the usp at its campus in funafuti , tuvalu , rather than its main campus in fiji , can listen to lectures broadcast from fiji , use audio and video-conferencing facilities and employ the uspnet system for communication with lecturers and other students . tuvalu , a tiny country with a population of only 11,000 , has only four embassies abroad : its permanent mission to the united nations in new york , its embassy to the european union in brussels , its newly opened embassy to the republic of china in taipei since 2013 , and its high commission to fiji in suva . it is referred to as a high commission rather than an embassy because tuvalu and fiji are both members of the commonwealth of nations . fiji in turn does not maintain any diplomatic presence in tuvalu , but does have           , including tuvalu . fiji remains tuvalu s gateway to the outside world . the only flights to and from funafuti international airport are via suva , on air fiji . in addition , fiji is by far tuvalus largest source of imports . when the head of fiji s military , commodore voreqe bainimarama , took power in fiji in a coup in 2006 , tuvalu did not join countries such as australia , new zealand or samoa in condemning the new regime . tuvalu remained supportive of bainimarama s statements that he would restore democracy on his own schedule . akuila yabaki , of the citizens  constitutional forum in fiji , noted that tuvalu had little choice in the matter , as it was heavily dependent on maintaining good relations with fiji . in 2013 , sir gordon ward , a british national serving as chief justice of tuvalu , was a denied a visa by the fijian government to transit via fiji on his flight to tuvalu . ward had previously sat as a judge in fiji s court of appeal , before resigning in protest against           tuvalu other than through fiji , tuvalu s chief justice was unable to enter tuvalu . fiji remained unresponsive to tuvalu s attempts to resolve the matter , although the incident was said not to have severely affected bilateral relations .  references
